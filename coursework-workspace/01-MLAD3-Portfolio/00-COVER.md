## 📖 MY PERSONAL PORTFOLIO

My Personal Portfolio is where I say where I want to get to and how I am going to get there. It is where I capture my objectives, plans and the standards I will set for myself within the Team Entrepreneurship Programme.

I share my portfolio with my Team Company, to whom I am accountable, and from whom I gain support.

It is a "living document". I continually update it to measure and evidence my progress and success. It is a tool for learning, shared with my Team and my Coach.

## 📸 A PHOTO OF ME

**Image Description:** Working from villa in Bali, Indonesia

**Caption:**

I chose this picture from my time in Bali because it represents a pivotal risk-taking moment in my entrepreneurial journey. I made the decision to travel despite potential consequences - risking being kicked off the course, possible legal complications with my community service, and disappointing my parents. This calculated risk embodied the entrepreneurial mindset I'm developing. Now, working from my villa in Bali with my team on our business ventures, this image reminds me that strategic risk-taking and stepping outside comfort zones are essential for growth. It symbolizes the transition from fear-based decision making to confident entrepreneurial action.

## 💬 MY FAVOURITE QUOTE

**Quote:**

> "How big would you dream if you knew you couldn't fail?"

**Why I chose it (79 words):**

This quote inspires me to overcome self-doubt and pursue limitless goals. It drove me to launch my Agency and guides my objective to lead innovative projects, shaping my personal and professional growth. As I transition into Year Three focused on unicore development, this mindset pushes me to think beyond conventional boundaries and embrace the entrepreneurial journey with confidence and ambition.
