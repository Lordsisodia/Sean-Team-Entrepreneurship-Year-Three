## 📝 CHANGE LOG

| Date | What did you change? | Reason for change |
|------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **04 Oct 2025** | Rewrote all competency labels across Learning Contract and SMART Objectives to use UWE TE Competency Framework. Changed "AI Automation & Context Engineering" → Innovation Management, "Advanced Time Management" → Self-Management, "App Development Architecture" → Innovation Management, "Team Building & Systems Design" → Strategic Leadership. | AI model feedback (Claude Sonnet 4.5) identified fundamental competency framework misunderstanding. Initial submission listed technical skills/achievements as competencies, violating marking criteria requirement to "refer to the competency framework used." Correction ensures academic rigor and explicit UWE TE Framework alignment. |
| **04 Oct 2025** | Cut "Where Am I Now?" section from 1,111 words to 788 words. Reduced multiple sections to comply with word limits. | Word count violation of 39% over limit could result in automatic grade cap at 40% fail. Academic assessment protocols require strict boundary compliance. Condensed redundant content while maintaining core evidence. |
| **04 Oct 2025** | Revised Objective 6 from "10,000+ clients, £100K monthly" to "1,000 clients (100 agencies × 10), £50K monthly." Changed Objectives 1-2 from task-count metrics to hours-logged metrics (70 focused hours/week target). | AI analysis identified overly optimistic projections. 100 clients per agency unrealistic for 4-month timeline with zero current partnerships. Hours-logged superior metric to task-count for productivity measurement. Demonstrates Entrepreneurial Judgment through evidence-based realistic goal setting. |
| **04 Oct 2025** | Added progress ratings (5-40%) with evidence-based rationale to all 6 SMART objectives. Created changelog documentation system and feedback response framework. | Marking criteria requires ongoing progress tracking and evidence of self-managed learning. Progress ratings demonstrate current status and accountability for objective achievement. Changelog and feedback systems show commitment to continuous improvement and responsiveness to formative feedback. |

## 💬 FEEDBACK & RESPONSE

| Date | Name and feedback received | How was it acted upon? |
|------|---------------------------|----------------------|
| **4 October 2025** | **AI Model - Claude Sonnet 4.5 (Harsh Marking Analysis):** "Critical competency framework misunderstanding. You've listed 'AI Automation & Context Engineering' as competency - this is a skill, not UWE TE Framework competency. Current grade: 52-58% borderline fail. Word count violations: 1,111 words (800 max) = 39% over. Missing: Change Log, Feedback Table, Activity Approvals. Competencies sections scored 25-40% (clear fail)." | Complete portfolio revision: (1) Rewrote all competency sections using actual UWE TE Framework competencies, (2) Cut 323 words from "Where Am I Now", (3) Created Change Log and Feedback systems, (4) Added progress tracking to objectives. **Critical evaluation:** Accepted framework correction as valid academic requirement. Challenged word count severity but complied with limits. **Result:** Grade improved from 52-58% to 68-72%. |
| **4 October 2025** | **AI Model - Claude Sonnet 4.5 (SMART Objectives Analysis):** "Same competency mistake in SMART Objectives. 'Advanced Time Management & Prioritization' is not UWE TE competency. Should be 'Self-Management'. Changelog empty (0%), Feedback table empty (0%) = -30-40% penalty. Task-based metrics inferior to hours-logged for productivity measurement." | Relabeled all SMART objective competencies to UWE TE Framework terms with Learning Contract cross-references. Changed productivity metrics from tasks to hours. Created changelog entries and feedback documentation framework. **Critical evaluation:** Agreed task-count metric was flawed - hours better reflects actual work capacity. Recognized need for consistent framework usage across all portfolio components. |
| **4 October 2025** | **AI Model - Claude Opus 1.1 (Planned - Multi-Model Consensus):** [To be executed - seeking perspective on timeline feasibility, conversion rate assumptions, work capacity sustainability, and strategic priority sequencing] | [Will document Opus feedback and response actions here after consensus analysis] |
| **4 October 2025** | **Gemini 2.0 Pro (Planned - Multi-Model Consensus):** [To be executed - seeking optimistic entrepreneurship perspective on making ambitious goals more achievable] | [Will document Gemini feedback and integration of optimization recommendations] |
| **4 October 2025** | **AI Model - DeepSeek R1 (Planned - Technical Analysis):** [To be executed - seeking technical project management perspective on app development timelines and dependency chains] | [Will document technical feasibility assessment and timeline adjustments] |
