## ✍️ YOUR CONTENT TEMPLATE

### Context (50-75 words)
- What specific leadership challenge did you address?
- Why is this competency critical for your exit strategy?
- What did you hope to achieve?

```
[Your response here]

Example: I addressed my delegation resistance by implementing weekly delegation sessions with Sam.
My instinct is always to do things myself because "it's faster than explaining," but this approach
won't scale to 1,000 partnerships. I needed to build Sam's capability to manage partnerships
independently, which requires documenting systems, providing context, and resisting the urge to
step back in.

### Action Taken (150-200 words)
- Specific steps to develop this competency
- Leadership activities undertaken
- Timeline and frequency
- Resources and support utilized

[Your response here]

Example: I implemented weekly delegation sessions every Friday at 2 PM. Instead of just assigning
tasks, I focused on building Sam's capability. First, I documented all partnership management processes:
outreach scripts, follow-up templates, objection handling, pipeline tracking. Then I walked Sam through
each system, had him practice while I observed, and gradually increased his autonomy. I also conducted
a team capability assessment with Sam to identify his strengths (relationship building) and growth
areas (technical system navigation). I sought mentorship from TE alumni who have successfully managed
teams, specifically asking how they overcame delegation resistance. The key insight: delegation isn't
about offloading work—it's about developing others.

### Critical Evaluation (200-250 words)
- What leadership growth did you achieve?
- What challenges did you face in developing others?
- What would you do differently?
- Honest assessment of your delegation effectiveness

```
[Your response here]

Example: The hardest part was resisting the urge to step back in when Sam didn't do things exactly
how I would. In early October, Sam sent an outreach email that I thought was too casual. My instinct
was to rewrite it, but I forced myself to let it go. The result? He got a reply from an agency owner
who specifically mentioned appreciating the authentic tone. I was wrong, and the lesson stuck.

However, I struggled with consistency. Some weeks I was too busy and skipped the delegation session,
reverting to doing everything myself. This inconsistency undermined Sam's development. I also realized
I wasn't delegating the important stuff—strategy, client relationships—but only the administrative
work. Real delegation means delegating decision-making authority, not just tasks.

The team capability assessment revealed something important: Sam is much better than me at building
rapport in initial calls, while I'm stronger at technical system design. Rather than trying to make
Sam a mini-me, I should be leveraging his natural strengths and having him focus on relationship
building while I handle technical setup. This wasn't the original plan, but it's more effective.

What I'd do differently: Start earlier. I should have begun systematic delegation in September,
not October. Also, I should have created a delegation roadmap with clear milestones for Sam's
autonomy, rather than improvising week to week.

### Learning Achieved (100-125 words)
- Specific leadership skills developed
- How this connects to your 1,000 partnership goal
- Impact on your ability to scale
- Changes in your leadership mindset

```
[Your response here]

Example: I learned that effective delegation requires systematic preparation, not just willingness.
You need documented processes, clear success criteria, and trust-building over time. I also learned
that developing others isn't about making them clones of you—it's about identifying their strengths
and creating roles where they can excel. This directly connects to scaling to 1,000 partnerships:
I can't manage 1,000 partners alone, but I can build systems and develop people who can. The mindset
shift from "doing" to "enabling" is essential for scaling anything. I'm now thinking about how to
delegate not just to Sam, but to future team members as partnerships scale.
```

---

### Future Application (50-75 words)
- How will you continue developing Strategic Leadership?
- What's the next milestone in Sam's development?
- How will this competency support your post-TE goals?

```
[Your response here]

Example: Next milestone is Sam managing 25 partnerships independently by end of November, then
50 by March. Beyond Sam, I'm documenting the delegation process so I can replicate it with future
team members. Post-TE, Strategic Leadership will be critical whether I'm scaling the partnership
empire, exiting to a larger company (managing the transition), or starting a new venture (building
effective teams from day one).
