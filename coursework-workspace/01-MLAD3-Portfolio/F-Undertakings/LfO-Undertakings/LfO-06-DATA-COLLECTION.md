Select all that apply and provide details:
- [ ] Productivity frameworks or systems (which one?)
- [ ] Time management research or book (title/author?)
- [ ] Personal experiments with productivity methods
- [ ] Analysis of your 6-week internal app delay
- [ ] Learning about prioritization frameworks (Eisenhower Matrix, etc.)
- [ ] Mentoring or coaching on productivity
- [ ] Built your own time management app
- [ ] Other: _______________

**Q2. When did you engage with this learning?**
- Approximate month: ___________
- Was it triggered by a specific productivity challenge?

**Q3. Why did you choose this specific learning activity?**
- Was it due to your "6 weeks on wrong app" challenge?
- Were you trying to understand why urgent wins over important?
- What productivity challenge were you facing?

---

### Part B: Critical Evaluation

**Q4. What was the BIGGEST insight about productivity or prioritization?**

Be specific:
- "I learned that without systematic prioritization, I always choose what feels urgent"
- "I discovered that 6 weeks on internal app was strategic misalignment, not just a mistake"
- "I realized that 'feeling productive' doesn't equal 'being strategic'"
- "I learned that I need metrics (80% alignment) not just intuition"

**Q5. What challenged your previous assumptions about productivity?**

For example:
- Did you think working hard on the wrong thing was still productive?
- Did you believe urgency always indicated importance?
- Did you assume technical work was inherently high-value?
- Did you think you could prioritize without a system?

**Q6. What surprised you the most about your 6-week internal app delay?**

Unexpected findings about:
- Why you spent 6 weeks on internal app instead of partnership/client apps
- What felt "productive" but was actually strategically wrong
- The difference between activity and progress
- Why you didn't catch the misalignment sooner

**Q7. How did this learning change your approach to time management?**

Specific changes in your:
- Use of time-blocking or priority frameworks?
- Approach to daily/weekly prioritization?
- Building internal time management app?
- Tracking "80% alignment" metric?

---

### Part C: Synthesis

**Q8. How does this connect to other things you've learned or experienced?**

For example:
- Does this relate to your PDR automation success (was that well-prioritized)?
- Does it connect to your Bali performance under pressure?
- Does it align with or contradict your INTJ tendency to focus deeply?
- Does it relate to other productivity or self-management learning?

**Q9. Are there any productivity frameworks or theories this relates to?**

For example:
- Eisenhower Matrix (urgent vs important)?
- Time blocking theories?
- Deep work vs shallow work?
- Pareto principle (80/20 rule)?
- OKRs or goal-alignment frameworks?

**Q10. Does this learning conflict with or support other sources you've encountered?**

Have you encountered different approaches to productivity? Does this align or contradict other experts or research on time management?

---

### Part D: Application

**Q11. How have you actually APPLIED this productivity learning?**

Be specific:
- Built internal time management app (what does it do)?
- Implemented time-blocking or priority reviews?
- Created weekly priority review process?
- Started tracking 80% alignment metric?

**Q12. What specific impact has this had on your work?**

For example:
- Changed how you allocate time across projects?
- Prevented similar misallocation (like the 6-week delay)?
- Improved your strategic vs urgent decision-making?
- Created measurable time alignment tracking?

**Q13. How does this support your Self-Management competency?**

Which aspects:
- Moving from "inefficient prioritization" to "effective personal organization"?
