## 📈 Learning Outcomes from YouTube Research

### What I Learned:
1. **Framework Landscape Changes Weekly:** Videos from 2 days ago address features that didn't exist a month ago
2. **Modularity is Essential:** Every expert creator emphasizes modular, pluggable systems
3. **Production Patterns Exist:** Proven patterns from companies like Anthropic, Microsoft
4. **Memory is Critical:** Multiple creators identify shared memory as missing piece
5. **Specialization Works:** Specialized agents > general-purpose agents

### How It Changed My Thinking:
- **Initial Assumption:** Find perfect framework and use it
- **After Video Research:** No perfect framework exists; build modular system that can use any framework
- **Initial Approach:** Build general-purpose agent
- **After Video Research:** Build specialized agents that coordinate hierarchically
- **Initial Priority:** Focus on features
- **After Video Research:** Focus on infrastructure (memory, orchestration, skills)
