# COMPETENCIES DEVELOPED

**Primary Competency:** Entrepreneurial Judgment (Self-related)

This learning developed my ability to make strategic decisions under uncertainty about AI infrastructure architecture. Specifically:

- **Strategic Resource Allocation:** Choosing to build modular, future-proof infrastructure rather than committing to a single framework
- **Timing Decisions:** Recognizing the 9-month window for AI automation advantage and prioritizing infrastructure development
- **Technical vs Strategic Trade-offs:** Understanding when to build vs. integrate vs. wait for better solutions

**Secondary Competencies:**
- **Self-Management:** 80% time alignment with strategic priorities through automated systems
- **Service Design & Delivery:** Infrastructure enables scaling to 100+ partnerships
- **Strategic Leadership:** Delegation through AI agents rather than human delegation
