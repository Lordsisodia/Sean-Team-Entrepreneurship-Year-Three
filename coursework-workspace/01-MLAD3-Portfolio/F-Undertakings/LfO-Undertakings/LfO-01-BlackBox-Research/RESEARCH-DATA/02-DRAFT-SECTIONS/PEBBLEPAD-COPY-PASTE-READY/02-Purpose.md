My primary exit strategy is building a Partnership-Based AI Automation Empire targeting 1,000 agency partnerships within 9 months, before AI commoditization occurs. To achieve this scale, I need infrastructure that can manage compute, coordinate multiple AI agents, and scale operations efficiently across partnerships and client work.

After two years of using AI in my agency and client work, I identified critical gaps: constantly switching between AI providers, no centralized memory for agent conversations, and fragmented frameworks (BE MAD, SPEC KIT, etc.) that weren't systematized. Black Box addresses these gaps by creating a modular infrastructure layer that allows any agent to access shared context, organize tools systematically, and plug in new frameworks as they emerge.

This directly supports my Entrepreneurial Judgment competency (strategic decisions under uncertainty) and Self-Management competency (80% time alignment). By building scalable AI infrastructure now, I position myself to capitalize on the 9-month AI automation window before commoditization occurs.
