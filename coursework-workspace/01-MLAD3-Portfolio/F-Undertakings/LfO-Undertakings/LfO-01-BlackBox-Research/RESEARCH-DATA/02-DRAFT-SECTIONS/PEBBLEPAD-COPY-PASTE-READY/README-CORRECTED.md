## ✅ CORRECTIONS MADE:

### Issue Found:
The original LfO used incorrect competency categorizations and only addressed 4 of your 6 official Year 3 competencies.

### Corrections Applied:

| ✅ Service Design & Delivery | PROJECTS | Yes |
| ✅ Financial Management | PROJECTS | **Yes (NEW - was missing)** |

**3. Evidence Added for Missing Competencies:**
- **Financial Management:** Infrastructure investment vs. short-term revenue decisions, platform economics analysis, resource allocation prioritization
- **Professional Communication:** Technical communication for non-technical stakeholders, community engagement, documentation and knowledge sharing
