### Overall Validity Assessment

**Trustworthiness Breakdown:**
- **VERY HIGH:** 8 sources (62%) - Official documentation and peer-reviewed research
- **HIGH:** 4 sources (31%) - Production frameworks with strong community
- **MEDIUM:** 1 source (7%) - Secondary interpretation

**Bias Analysis:**
- **Vendor Bias:** 8 sources (62%) from companies selling AI tools/platforms
- **Academic Bias:** 2 sources (15%) - may be theoretical not production-tested
- **Community Bias:** 3 sources (23%) - reflect specific methodologies

**Critical Limitations:**
1. **US-Centric Perspective:** All sources are from US companies or Western academia - no European, Asian, or Global South perspectives represented
2. **Commercial Motivations:** 77% of sources are from vendors with commercial interests in promoting their approaches
3. **Production vs Theory Gap:** Academic papers may not reflect real-world constraints; vendor docs may not show failures
4. **Single-Perspective Dominance:** Anthropic represents 38% of sources (5 of 13) - potential over-reliance on one company's approach
5. **Emerging Field Volatility:** Sources from Oct 2025-Jan 2026 only - long-term viability of approaches unproven

**Triangulation Value:**
Despite limitations, cross-referencing multiple sources (official docs + academic papers + production code) provides validation of core concepts:
- Modular agent architecture confirmed across 6+ sources
- Memory systems as critical gap validated by 3+ sources
- Hierarchical coordination patterns supported by 4+ sources
- Skills system importance confirmed by 2+ sources

**Cultural Bias Acknowledgment:**
This research reflects a Western, commercial perspective on AI agent development. Future research should include:
- European AI frameworks (GDPR compliance, EU AI Act alignment)
- Asian multi-agent systems research (Chinese, Japanese approaches)
- Academic sources outside US tech bubble
- Public-interest and open-source community perspectives

**Overall Validity:** VERY HIGH with noted limitations
