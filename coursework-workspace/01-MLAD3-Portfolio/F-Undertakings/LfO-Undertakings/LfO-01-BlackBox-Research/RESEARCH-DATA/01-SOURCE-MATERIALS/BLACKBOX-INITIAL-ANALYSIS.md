# Black Box LfO #1 - Initial Analysis & Data Collection

**Date:** January 20, 2026
**LfO Topic:** Building Agentic AI Systems Infrastructure (Black Box Framework)
**Learning Period:** October 29, 2025 - Ongoing
**Type:** External (self-directed research and development)

---

## ✅ WHAT WE KNOW SO FAR

### Your Description of Black Box:
> "Building an intelligence infrastructure which Agentic AI systems can use to track, maintain, and scale inference."

> "The core infrastructure layer for our AI to use everything and actually have real application into my business. It literally is the highest ROI thing I could possibly do."

### The Problem You're Solving:
After using AI for 2 years in your agency and client work, you identified critical gaps:
- **Gaps in current AI systems** - things they don't do well
- **Constant provider switching** - swapping different AI intelligence providers and inference providers
- **Need for your own database** - where all agent chats are stored and any agent can view all of it
- **Need for organized frameworks** - systemized organization for existing tools like:
  - BE MAD method
  - SPEC KIT
  - Other frameworks you use

### What Black Box Does (from code analysis):
- **Agent Infrastructure** - BaseAgent, AgentLoader, SkillManager classes
- **Multi-Agent System** - DeveloperAgent, AnalystAgent, ArchitectAgent implemented
- **Skill System** - Skills attachable to agents, categorization, enable/disable
- **Task Management** - AgentTask, AgentResult, AgentStatus for execution
- **Memory/Context** - Token compression, context extraction, TODO implementation
- **Tools Integration** - Frameworks integration system
- **Parallel Execution** - Agents can work in parallel

## 📊 FRAMEWORKS YOU ANALYZED

From your description:
> "I analyzed all the current infrastructure that other people are using to place on top of AI models to make it more intelligent. I analysed all of their skills systems, how they work, broke down what additional things each one brought to the table, and figured out how I could wrap it together to utilise all of them."

### You analyzed:
- **Skills systems** - how different frameworks implement AI agent skills
- **Infrastructure patterns** - how others build on top of LLMs
- **Tool integration** - how frameworks integrate tools
- **Memory systems** - how others handle context/memory
- **Orchestration** - how others manage multi-agent workflows

### ❓ Need from You:
- **Which specific frameworks** did you analyze? (e.g., LangChain, AutoGPT, BabyAGI, CrewAI, etc.)
- **What did each bring to the table?**
- **What was missing** from each that you wanted to combine?
