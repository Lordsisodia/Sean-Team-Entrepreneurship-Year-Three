## Marking Criteria (90-100% Outstanding)

### What Assessors Are Looking For

**From the marking scheme:**
> "Detailed responses showing significant effort" and "strategic thinking evident"

For Q3 specifically, this means:

1. **Specific, Measurable Goals** - Not vague aspirations
   - ❌ "I want to grow my business"
   - ✅ "I aim to achieve 1,000 validated partnerships by July 2026, generating £100K in annual revenue"

2. **Strategic Rationale** - Not just what, but WHY
   - ❌ "This is a good goal because it's ambitious"
   - ✅ "The AI automation market is projected to grow 40% YoY, and my agency model addresses the £50K+ entry barrier for SMBs"

3. **Connection to Self-Assessment** - Uses Q2 insights
   - ❌ Generic goals disconnected from who you are
   - ✅ Goals that leverage your strategic thinking (INTJ) while addressing your operational challenges

4. **Market Validation** - Shows understanding of context
   - ❌ No mention of market reality
   - ✅ References market size, competition, trends

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- ❌ **Too vague** - "I want to be successful" / "I want to learn a lot"
- ❌ **Not ambitious enough** - Goals too easily achieved
- ❌ **Unrealistic** - Goals completely disconnected from reality
- ❌ **No rationale** - Goals stated without strategic thinking
- ❌ **Disconnected from self-assessment** - Doesn't use Q2 insights
- ❌ **Too much "how"** - That belongs in Q4

### Outstanding vs. First-Class

| Aspect | First-Class (70-79%) | Outstanding (90-100%) |
|--------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Clarity | Generally clear goals | Specific, measurable outcomes |
| Strategic thinking | Some rationale present | Clear strategic analysis |
| Market awareness | Brief mention | Deep understanding of context |
| Self-alignment | Some connection | Strong connection to Q2 insights |
| Ambition | Reasonable goals | Ambitious but achievable |

## Tips for Staying Within Word Count

At 300 words, this section needs to be concise:

1. **Focus on outcomes, not process** - The "how" belongs in Q4
2. **Be specific but concise** - "1,000 partnerships by July 2026" (5 words) vs "A really large number of partnerships by some time next year" (12 words, less clear)
3. **Cut justifications** - Don't over-explain why, just give the key rationale
4. **Use bullet points** - For listing multiple goals
