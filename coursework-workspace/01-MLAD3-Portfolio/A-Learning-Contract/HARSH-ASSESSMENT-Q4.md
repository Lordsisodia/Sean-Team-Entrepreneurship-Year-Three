# Harsh Marking Assessment: Year 3 Learning Contract Q4 (How Will I Get There?)

**Date:** January 20, 2026  
**Assessor:** AI Assistant (applying Year 2 feedback lessons)  
**Section:** Q4 - How Will I Get There?  
**Current Word Count:** 725 words (target: ~700)  
**Current Grade Estimate:** 68-75% (Upper Second to First Class)

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**This is your strongest section so far.**

**Current Grade:** 68-75% (Upper Second to First Class)  
**Target Grade:** 90-100% (Outstanding)  
**Gap:** 15-22 percentage points

**Key Finding:** This section demonstrates the self-reflection and specific examples that Year 2 feedback requested. However, it still suffers from the same pattern that limited Year 2: **too venture-focused, not enough about personal development.**

## CRITICAL ISSUE #1: All 6 Competencies Are Venture-Focused 🔴

### The Problem

**Year 2 Self-Leadership (62%) Feedback:**
> "There is a strong focus on your venture which is commendable. However, next year ensure you balance this more with specific self and team objectives."

**Current Draft Q4:** The exact same pattern exists.

### Evidence from Current Draft

| Competency | Focus | Is it venture-focused? |
|------------|-------|----------------------|
| Strategic Leadership | Delegating to Sam for partnerships | ✅ Yes |
| Professional Communication | Increasing adoption of recommendations | ✅ Yes |
| Service Design & Delivery | Building agency partnerships | ✅ Yes |
| Financial Management | Revenue targets | ✅ Yes |
| Self-Management | Time allocation across projects | ✅ Yes |
| Entrepreneurial Judgment | App development prioritization | ✅ Yes |

**Assessment:** ALL 6 competencies are venture-focused.

**What Year 2 feedback required:**
> "Ensure you balance this more with specific self and team objectives."

**What 90-100% requires:**
- 2 self-development competencies (habits, mindset, behaviours)
- 2 team-development competencies (team targets, communication)
- 2 venture competencies (pitching, financial, project management)

**Current balance:**
- Self-development: 0 of 6
- Team-development: 0.5 of 6 (Strategic Leadership has team elements)
- Venture: 5.5 of 6

**This is worse than Year 2, not better.**

## CRITICAL ISSUE #2: No Values/Ethics Evaluation 🔴

### The Problem

**Year 2 Enquiry (40%) Feedback:**
> "All the LfO evidence is very focused on your AI venture elements, and lack thorough and meaningful evaluation of professional values, ethics, practices and behaviours."

**Current Draft Q4:** The exact same issue.

### Evidence

**Values/ethics mentioned:** 0 times

**Practices/behaviours evaluated:** 0 times

**What markers want (90-100%):**
> "Self-Management development requires alignment of my personal values with my daily practices. I value continuous learning, yet I found myself skipping learning blocks in September because partnership outreach felt more urgent. This values-practice gap caused me guilt and reduced my effectiveness—I was rushing through outreach without being fully present. In October, I'm implementing a 'values first' approach: each morning, I identify which value I'll prioritize that day, and I protect time for it ruthlessly. This isn't just about productivity; it's about integrity—living in alignment with what I say matters to me."

**Notice:**
- ✅ Values explicitly mentioned
- ✅ Practice gap identified
- ✅ Personal consequence included (guilt, reduced effectiveness)
- ✅ Integrity connection made
- ✅ Specific behavioural change described

## CRITICAL ISSUE #3: Missing Team Apollo Specificity 🟡

### The Problem

**Year 2 Practice (53%) Feedback:**
> "Each of these could also be related to your experiences with Team Apollo, to strengthen the evidence in being more specific and directly related to your experience on the programme too."

### Evidence from Current Draft

**What's working:**
- ✅ Sam mentioned (Strategic Leadership)
- ✅ Some specific situations (September time allocation data)

**What's missing:**
- ❌ Pranav not mentioned
- ❌ No other Team Apollo members
- ❌ No specific team situations beyond Sam/delegation
- ❌ No dates/timeframes for team interactions
- ❌ No specific examples of communication challenges WITH team members

**Should include:**
> "Professional Communication: In October 2024, I presented the partnership framework to Pranav and Sam. Pranav immediately pointed out three flaws in the revenue model that I hadn't considered. Instead of feeling defensive (my usual pattern), I acknowledged his input and we revised the model together. The result was a stronger framework that both felt ownership of. However, when I presented the same framework to a potential agency partner, I struggled to explain the technical components clearly, and the conversation ended without commitment. This contrast—I can accept feedback from my team but struggle to communicate externally—reveals that my communication challenge isn't about 'influence' generally, but specifically about communicating with non-technical people outside my immediate team."

**Notice:**
- ✅ Specific team member (Pranav)
- ✅ Specific date (October 2024)
- ✅ Specific situation (framework presentation)
- ✅ Personal pattern identified (defensive vs accepting)
- ✅ Comparison made (team vs external communication)
- ✅ Specific learning (non-technical communication gap)

---

## CRITICAL ISSUE #4: Good Self-Awareness, But Could Be More Critical 🟡

### The Problem

**Year 2 Self-Leadership (62%) Feedback:**
> "More critical evaluation of your own development would have added more depth."

### Evidence from Current Draft

**What's working (good examples of self-awareness):**
> "My instinct is to do everything myself because it's faster than explaining. This is unsustainable at scale."
> "The gap between my technical recommendations and their implementation isn't about the quality of my ideas—it's about my ability to influence and persuade."
> "The brutal truth from September data: I spent 60% of my time on technical work that could have been delegated or deferred, and only 20% on partnership outreach."

**This is excellent self-awareness—the style Year 2 feedback requested.**

**What could be more critical:**

**Example - More critical version:**
> "Self-Management through my internal app reveals a disturbing pattern: I have the data but I don't always act on it. In September, my app showed I was spending only 20% of time on partnership outreach, yet I continued the same pattern for three weeks before making changes. This suggests that self-awareness alone isn't enough—I need accountability structures. I'm now implementing a 'peer review' system where Sam checks my weekly time allocation and calls out misalignment. This is humbling—I need oversight from someone I'm supposed to be leading—but it's necessary because my current patterns are stronger than my good intentions."

**Notice:**
- ✅ More honest about failure (didn't act on data for 3 weeks)
- ✅ Deeper insight (awareness ≠ action)
- ✅ Vulnerable admission (need oversight from someone I lead)
- ✅ Specific solution (peer review system)

## WHAT'S WORKING (Strengths to Maintain)

### ✅ Excellent: Specific Examples and Metrics

**The specificity in this draft is exactly what Year 2 feedback requested:**
> "Sam independently managing 50+ partnerships by March 2026"
> "Adoption rate increases from 40% to 80% by February 2026"
> "100 validated partnerships by January 2026"
> "£5K+ monthly by December 2025"

### ✅ Excellent: Honest Self-Assessment

**Current levels are honest, not inflated:**
> "Delegating poorly"
> "Good technical communication, weak influence"
> "Zero partnerships"
> "Systems focus, no revenue"

This is the right approach—keep this honesty.

### ✅ Excellent: Concrete Action Plans

**Each competency has specific development activities:**
> "Weekly delegation sessions with Sam"
> "Recording and reviewing my interactions"
> "Pilot testing with 10 agencies"
> "Time-blocking via internal app"

## CONVERSION PLAN: How to Fix This

### Step 1: Rebalance Competencies (2-2-2 Rule)

**Current (All venture-focused):**
1. Strategic Leadership (venture)
2. Professional Communication (venture)
3. Service Design & Delivery (venture)
4. Financial Management (venture)
5. Self-Management (venture)
6. Entrepreneurial Judgment (venture)

**Fix (2-2-2 balance):**

**Self-Development (2 competencies):**
1. **Values Alignment** (NEW): Ensuring daily practices align with stated values
2. **Emotional Intelligence** (NEW): Developing empathy and self-regulation in team interactions

**Team-Development (2 competencies):**
3. **Mentoring Others** (MODIFIED): From Strategic Leadership—focus on developing Sam's capabilities
4. **Team Communication** (MODIFIED): From Professional Communication—focus on internal team dynamics

**Venture (2 competencies):**
5. **Service Design & Delivery** (KEEP): Partnership development
6. **Financial Management** (KEEP): Revenue and resource allocation

**Remove or repurpose:**
- Self-Management → Merge into Values Alignment
- Entrepreneurial Judgment → This is a meta-skill, not a standalone competency

### Step 2: Add Values/Ethics Evaluation

**For each competency, add a values/ethics dimension:**

**Example - Modified Strategic Leadership:**
> "Strategic Leadership requires me to balance efficiency with development. My value of 'excellence' pushes me to do things myself because I can do them faster. But my value of 'team growth' requires me to delegate even when it's inefficient initially. When I delegated the partnership outreach to Sam in October, the first week was painful—he made mistakes I wouldn't have made, and I felt anxious watching him struggle. My excellence value screamed 'step in and fix it.' But my growth value reminded me that the point isn't just excellent outreach—it's developing Sam's capability. This values conflict is something I'm navigating each week in our delegation sessions."

### Step 3: Add Team Apollo Specificity

**For each team-related competency, add:**
- Specific team member names beyond just Sam
- Specific dates and situations
- Specific outcomes and learning

**Example - Team Communication:**
> "In September 2024, during a team planning session, Pranav suggested we pivot from the agency partnership model to direct client work. My immediate internal reaction was dismissal—this doesn't align with the strategy I've spent months developing. But instead of immediately rejecting his idea, I asked questions to understand his perspective. It turned out he was seeing something I wasn't: agencies were hesitant to commit because they didn't see the value clearly. This led us to redesign the partnership offering entirely, making the value proposition much clearer. The interaction taught me that my 'strategic vision' can become a blind spot if I'm not open to team input. I'm now practicing 'strategic curiosity'—asking questions first instead of defending positions."

## GRADE BREAKDOWN BY SECTION

| Section | Current Grade | Issue | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-------|-----|
| Strategic Leadership | 70% | Good specificity, venture-focused | Add values conflict dimension |
| Professional Communication | 65% | Good self-awareness | Add team-specific examples with Pranav |
| Service Design & Delivery | 75% | Strong section | ✅ Keep as-is |
| Financial Management | 70% | Good, could add values | Add values-ethics about money |
| Self-Management | 72% | Excellent self-awareness | Merge into Values Alignment |
| Entrepreneurial Judgment | 68% | Good, but meta-skill | Convert to team-focused competency |

---

## FINAL ASSESSMENT

**Current Grade:** 68-75% (Upper Second to First Class)

**Why not 90%+:**
- All 6 competencies are venture-focused (same issue as Year 2)
- No values/ethics evaluation (same issue as Year 2 Enquiry)
- Limited Team Apollo specificity (same issue as Year 2 Practice)
- Could be more critical/self-reflective

**What's Working (This is your best section):**
- ✅ Excellent specificity and metrics
- ✅ Honest current levels (not inflated)
- ✅ Concrete action plans
- ✅ Good self-awareness about patterns
- ✅ Appropriate word count

**Target Grade:** 90-100% (Outstanding)

**What Needs to Change:**
1. Rebalance from 6 venture competencies to 2-2-2 (self-team-venture)
2. Add values/ethics evaluation to each competency
3. Expand Team Apollo examples beyond just Sam
4. Add more critical self-reflection (where you're failing despite good intentions)
5. Replace Entrepreneurial Judgment with a team-focused competency

---

## THE KEY INSIGHT

**This section demonstrates that you CAN write in the style Year 2 feedback requested.**

**The self-awareness, specificity, and honest assessment here is excellent.**

**The issue is structural (all 6 competencies are venture-focused), not stylistic.**

**Fix:** Apply the same quality of writing to a 2-2-2 competency balance, and this becomes a 90%+ section.
