## Marking Criteria (90-100% Outstanding)

### What Assessors Are Looking For

1. **Specific Competencies** - From UWE TE Framework
   - Clear identification
   - Connected to Q3 exit strategy

2. **Honest Current Levels** - Not inflated
   - Realistic assessment
   - Evidence from Year Two/current work

3. **Ambitious Targets** - But achievable
   - Challenging progression
   - Within timeframe and resources

4. **Specific Development Activities** - Not vague
   - Concrete actions
   - Real learning methods
   - Clear timeline

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- ❌ Vague competencies not from TE Framework
- ❌ Inflated current levels
- ❌ Unrealistic target levels (e.g., 3/10 → 10/10)
- ❌ Generic development activities ("I'll practice more")
- ❌ Disconnected from Q3 goals
