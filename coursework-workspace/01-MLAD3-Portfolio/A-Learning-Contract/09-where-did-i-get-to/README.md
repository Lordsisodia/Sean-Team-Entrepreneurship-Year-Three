## Marking Criteria (90-100% Outstanding)

### What Assessors Are Looking For

**From the marking scheme (40% of overall assignment):**
> "An in-depth critical evaluation of how Self-leadership activities have led to key learning about personal habits and behaviours, demonstrating high levels of self-awareness and personal accountability."

For Q5 specifically, this means:

1. **In-Depth Critical Evaluation** - Not superficial
   - ❌ "I learned a lot this year and grew as a person"
   - ✅ "Year Three revealed a fundamental tension: my strategic strength enabled rapid agency model development (4 weeks), but my operational weakness delayed internal tool deployment by 6 months, costing me first-mover advantage"

2. **Key Learning About Habits/Behaviours** - Specific insights
   - ❌ "I learned to manage my time better"
   - ✅ "I identified a pattern of 'perfectionism paralysis' - delaying decisions until I had complete information, which resulted in missed opportunities. The Partnership Framework broke this pattern by forcing 70% completion before agency engagement"

3. **High Self-Awareness** - Honest about self
   - ❌ "I generally performed well across my objectives"
   - ✅ "I achieved 7% of my partnership target (70/1,000) because I avoided rejection. This fear of 'no' meant I spent weeks perfecting materials instead of having conversations"

4. **Personal Accountability** - No excuses
   - ❌ "I didn't achieve my goals because of market conditions/team issues/other factors"
   - ✅ "I achieved 7% of my target because I prioritized technical perfection over strategic action. This was entirely within my control"

5. **Plans vs Reality** - Honest comparison
   - ❌ "I achieved most of what I set out to do"
   - ✅ "Goal: 1,000 partnerships. Actual: 70. Gap: 930. Root cause: Fear of rejection, perfectionism, lack of systematic outreach"

6. **Significant Future Plans** - Specific next steps
   - ❌ "I will continue to develop and grow"
   - ✅ "Post-graduation: (1) Implement daily rejection targets (5 conversations/day), (2) Hire operational lead to compensate for my weakness, (3) Set quarterly strategic reviews with advisory board"

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- ❌ **Chronological narrative** - "First I did this, then I did that..."
- ❌ **Only discussing successes** - Ignoring failures or downplaying them
- ❌ **Lack of critical evaluation** - Just describing what happened
- ❌ **Externalizing blame** - Blaming market, team, circumstances
- ❌ **Vague generalizations** - "I learned valuable lessons"
- ❌ **No connection to Q1-Q4** - Not referencing your original plan
- ❌ **Superficial treatment** - Skimming the surface of what you learned

### Outstanding vs. First-Class

| Aspect | First-Class (70-79%) | Outstanding (90-100%) |
|--------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Depth | Good evaluation of outcomes | Deep analysis of why and how |
| Honesty | Some discussion of failures | Candid about what went wrong |
| Self-awareness | Basic recognition | Profound insight into patterns |
| Accountability | Mostly owns outcomes | Fully responsible, no excuses |
| Plans vs reality | Some comparison | Detailed gap analysis |
| Future plans | General next steps | Specific, tangible actions |

## Tips for Success

### 1. Keep Notes Throughout the Year
Don't wait until April to start writing. Document:
- Significant wins and failures
- Insights about your habits/behaviours
- Times when you surprised yourself
- Patterns you notice

### 2. Be Brutally Honest
Outstanding grades come from honesty, not perfection. Admit:
- What you failed at
- Why you failed (root cause, not symptoms)
- What you would do differently

### 3. Go Deep, Not Broad
Better to deeply analyze 2-3 key learnings than superficially cover 10
- Choose the most significant insights
- Explore them thoroughly
- Connect them to theory/frameworks

### 4. Compare Plans vs Reality Specifically
Create a clear comparison table:
| Goal (Q3) | Actual | Gap | Root Cause |
|-----------|--------|-----|------------|
| 1,000 partnerships | 70 | 930 | Fear of rejection, perfectionism |

### 5. Focus on Behaviours, Not Outcomes
Assessors care about what you learned about YOURSELF, not just what you achieved:
- ❌ "I achieved X, Y, Z"
- ✅ "I achieved X because I developed the habit of..."
