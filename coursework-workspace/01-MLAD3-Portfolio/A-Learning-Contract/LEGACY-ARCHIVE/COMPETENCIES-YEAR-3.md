## 📋 6 COMPETENCIES TO DEVELOP IN YEAR 3

### 1. Strategic Leadership

**Rationale for Development:**

To overcome my delegation resistance challenge, I must develop Strategic Leadership competency, specifically "developing others through effective delegation and team development" (UWE, 2024, TE Competency Framework). My tendency to think "I'll spend more time explaining than doing it myself" prevents team scaling and limits my focus on high-value strategic work. The 1,000 partnership goal requires team leverage - I cannot personally manage this scale.

**Development Plan:**
- Weekly structured delegation sessions with Sam using coaching frameworks from TE workshops
- Monthly team capability assessments
- Mentorship from TE Programme leader on leadership practices

**Success Metric:**
Sam independently managing 50+ partnerships by March 2026

---

### 2. Professional Communication

**Rationale for Development:**

To address team leadership implementation challenges, I must develop Professional Communication competency: "influencing stakeholders through strategic communication and relationship management" (UWE, 2024). Providing technical direction without ensuring adoption reveals weakness in influence capability. Leadership requires both expertise AND ability to inspire action.

**Development Plan:**
- Communication skills training focused on influence and adoption (external course)
- Recording and reviewing team interactions for improvement
- Active participation in TE communication workshops

**Success Metric:**
Team Apollo adoption rate of my recommendations increases from current 40% to 80% by February 2026

---

### 3. Service Design & Delivery

**Rationale for Development:**

To address zero current agency partnerships despite 1,000 partnership goal, I must develop Service Design & Delivery competency: "creating and delivering value propositions that meet customer needs at scale" (UWE, 2024). This represents critical gap between vision and capability.

**Development Plan:**
- Partnership development mentorship from experienced SaaS scalers
- Systematic testing with 10 pilot agencies in Q1
- Iteration based on partner feedback
- Applying service design frameworks from EiEaE3 module

**Success Metric:**
100 validated partnerships by January 2026, proving model before full-scale launch

---

### 4. Financial Management

**Rationale for Development:**

To overcome revenue generation delay (avoiding "couple grand a month" targets), I must develop Financial Management competency: "strategic financial planning and resource allocation for growth" (UWE, 2024). Current focus on systems optimization without revenue pursuit creates sustainability risks and may miss market timing during AI industry evolution.

**Development Plan:**
- Financial modeling for partnership revenue streams
- Working with TE Finance mentor on pricing strategy and unit economics
- Creating financial dashboard for tracking progress

**Success Metric:**
Systematic testing generating £5K+ monthly by December 2025, validating model economics before partnership scaling

---

### 5. Self-Management

**Rationale for Development:**

To address time management across multiple projects challenge, I must develop Self-Management competency: "effective personal organization and priority management in complex environments" (UWE, 2024). Currently managing internal app development, client work, partnerships, and academic requirements without systematic prioritization creates inefficiency and delays.

**Development Plan:**
- Implementing time-blocking system via internal app completion (by November 1)
- Weekly priority reviews against exit strategy objectives
- Applying productivity frameworks from TE workshops

**Success Metric:**
80% time allocation alignment with strategic priorities, measured weekly via time tracking data

---

### 6. Entrepreneurial Judgment

**Rationale for Development:**

To strengthen app development priority management (6 weeks on internal app while client/partnership apps incomplete), I must develop Entrepreneurial Judgment competency: "making strategic decisions about resource allocation under uncertainty" (UWE, 2024). This requires balancing immediate needs against long-term infrastructure investment, recognizing opportunity costs.

**Development Plan:**
- Weekly strategic review of project priorities against exit strategy timeline
- Mentorship from successful entrepreneurs on resource allocation decisions
- Applying decision-making frameworks from RaLO3 module

**Success Metric:**
Partnership/client apps completed by December 2025, enabling Q1 2026 partnership launch on schedule
