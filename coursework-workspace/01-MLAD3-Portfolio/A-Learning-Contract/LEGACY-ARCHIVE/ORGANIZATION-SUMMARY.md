# Learning Contract Organization - Summary

**Date:** January 20, 2026  
**Status:** ✅ Reorganized and Ready for Work

---

## 🎯 WHAT WE DID

### 1. **Proper Folder Organization**
Moved the entire `learning-contract-planning` folder into the coursework workspace under:

```
coursework-workspace/01-MLAD3-Portfolio/A-Learning-Contract/PLANNING-ARCHIVE/
```

This keeps all your historical planning, marking criteria analysis, and reference materials together with the actual Learning Contract work.

### 2. **Created EXACT-PEBBLEPAD-COPY.txt**
Located at:
```
coursework-workspace/01-MLAD3-Portfolio/A-Learning-Contract/EXACT-PEBBLEPAD-COPY.txt
```

This is a clean template where you can paste your **exact** PebblePad content word-for-word.

---

## 📋 NEXT STEPS FOR YOU

### Step 1: Copy Your PebblePad Content

Open this file:
```
coursework-workspace/01-MLAD3-Portfolio/A-Learning-Contract/EXACT-PEBBLEPAD-COPY.txt
```

For each section in your PebblePad Learning Contract:
1. Copy the content **exactly** as it appears
2. Paste it into the corresponding section in the file
3. Include all formatting, tables, line breaks
4. Note the word counts shown in PebblePad

### Step 2: Share with Me

Once you've filled in `EXACT-PEBBLEPAD-COPY.txt`, let me know and I will:
- ✅ Verify exact word counts
- ✅ Compare against marking criteria
- ✅ Suggest precise improvements (e.g., "cut these 19 words from section 1")
- ✅ Ensure UWE TE Competency Framework alignment

## 🎯 WHY THIS ORGANIZATION?

### ✅ **Logical Grouping**
All MLAD3 Portfolio work is now under:
```
coursework-workspace/01-MLAD3-Portfolio/
```

### ✅ **Clear Separation**
- **Current Work**: Section files (Q1-Q5, Competencies)
- **Reference**: Planning archive with all historical analysis
- **Active Template**: EXACT-PEBBLEPAD-COPY.txt for your live content

### ✅ **Easy Navigation**
The README in each folder explains what's there and how to use it.

---

## 📊 PLATFORM STRATEGY DECISION

**Recommendation: 100% PebblePad for Submission**

### ✅ **What Goes in PebblePad:**
- ALL assessable content (Learning Contract, SMART Objectives)
- Process documentation (Change Log, Feedback, Activity Log)
- All Undertakings

### ✅ **What This Workspace Is For:**
- Private planning and development
- Draft versions and experiments
- Reference materials and analysis
- Local backup of your work

### ✅ **Workflow:**
1. Plan and draft in this workspace
2. Refine and polish locally
3. Copy final version to PebblePad
4. Submit through PebblePad

**Never link to this workspace from PebblePad** - markers won't follow external links.

---

## 🚀 READY TO BEGIN!

You're all set up. Next step:

1. Open `EXACT-PEBBLEPAD-COPY.txt`
2. Copy each section from your PebblePad
3. Paste it into the file
4. Let me know when it's ready

Then we'll optimize it together to hit that 90-100% target! 🎯
