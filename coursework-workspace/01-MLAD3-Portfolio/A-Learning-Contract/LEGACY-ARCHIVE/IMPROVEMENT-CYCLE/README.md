# Learning Contract Improvement Cycle

**Created:** January 20, 2026  
**Purpose:** Systematic first-principles evaluation and iteration to achieve 90-100% (Outstanding)

---

## 🎯 IMPROVEMENT CYCLE METHODOLOGY

### **Four-Step Iteration Process:**

1. **HARSH MARKING ASSESSMENT**  
   - Apply marking criteria rigorously  
   - Grade each section against 90-100% standards  
   - Identify specific gaps and weaknesses  
   - Provide numerical grade with evidence-based rationale

2. **FEEDBACK & IMPROVEMENT ANALYSIS**  
   - Document specific improvement opportunities  
   - Identify what's missing vs. what needs enhancement  
   - Prioritize by impact on final grade  
   - Create actionable recommendations

3. **DATA REQUIREMENTS IDENTIFICATION**  
   - Determine what evidence/examples needed  
   - Identify academic references required  
   - Specify metrics and quantifiable data  
   - Map stakeholder testimonials needed

4. **IMPLEMENTATION & RE-EVALUATION**  
   - Apply improvements to content  
   - Re-grade against same criteria  
   - Compare before/after scores  
   - Continue iteration until 90%+ achieved
