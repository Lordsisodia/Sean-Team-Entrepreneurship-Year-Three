## Marking Criteria (90-100% Outstanding)

### What Assessors Are Looking For

1. **Specific Competencies** - From UWE TE Framework
   - Clear identification of which competency
   - Evidence from Year Two work

2. **Honest Assessment** - Not inflated
   - Realistic current levels
   - Acknowledgment of growth areas still needed

3. **Concrete Evidence** - Not vague claims
   - Specific examples from Year Two
   - Measurable outcomes
   - Skills actually demonstrated

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- ❌ Vague competencies not from TE Framework
- ❌ Inflated current levels (all 9-10/10)
