## Marking Criteria (90-100% Outstanding)

### What Assessors Are Looking For

**From the marking scheme:**
> "Detailed responses showing significant effort" and "specific action steps"

For Q4 specifically, this means:

1. **Specific Competencies** - From UWE TE Framework
   - ❌ "I'll improve my communication and leadership"
   - ✅ "Service Design & Delivery (current 6/10, target 9/10): Develop agency onboarding process"

2. **Honest Current Levels** - Not inflated
   - ❌ "I'm already pretty good at most things, maybe 7-8/10"
   - ✅ "Self-Management: 5/10 - I struggle with prioritization, as evidenced by the 6-week delay on my internal app"

3. **Ambitious Targets** - But achievable
   - ❌ "Improve slightly" or "Become perfect at everything"
   - ✅ "From 6/10 to 9/10 in 6 months" (challenging but doable)

4. **Specific Actions** - Not vague intentions
   - ❌ "I'll practice more" / "I'll read books on this"
   - ✅ "Complete 3 agency partnerships by November, documenting the process for the white-label package"

5. **Clear Timeline** - Not "sometime in the future"
   - ❌ "I'll work on this throughout the year"
   - ✅ "November-January: Focus on Partnership Development; February-April: Scale to 50 agencies"

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- ❌ **Too many competencies** - Stick to 6 focused ones
- ❌ **All in one area** - Need mix across TE Framework categories
- ❌ **Vague actions** - "I'll practice" / "I'll improve"
- ❌ **No timeline** - Actions without when they'll happen
- ❌ **Disconnected from Q3** - Competencies that don't support exit strategy
- ❌ **Unrealistic targets** - Going from 2/10 to 10/10 in 3 months

### Outstanding vs. First-Class

| Aspect | First-Class (70-79%) | Outstanding (90-100%) |
|--------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Competencies | Listed with basic info | Well-chosen, aligned to Q3 |
| Honesty | Generally honest assessment | Candid about weaknesses |
| Actions | Some specific actions | Concrete, measurable steps |
| Timeline | General timeframe | Clear milestones and dates |
| Connection to Q3 | Some alignment | Strong strategic connection |

## Competency Selection Guidelines

4. **Leverage Q2 strengths** - Build on what you're already good at
5. **Are ambitious but achievable** - Challenging targets within the timeframe

### Example Mix:

- **1 from Managing Relationships** - Improve partnership/teaming skills
