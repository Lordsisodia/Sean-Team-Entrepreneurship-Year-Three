## Marking Criteria (90-100% Outstanding)

### What Assessors Are Looking For

**From the marking scheme:**
> "Detailed responses showing significant effort" and "in-depth critical evaluation"

For Q1 specifically, this means:

1. **Specific Examples** - Not vague statements
   - ❌ "I worked on some interesting projects"
   - ✅ "I led the development of an AI-powered automation tool that achieved 75 agent deployments"

2. **Critical Evaluation** - Not just description
   - ❌ "I learned a lot about leadership"
   - ✅ "I discovered that my leadership style was overly directive, which resulted in low team ownership"

3. **Honesty About Failures** - Not just successes
   - ❌ Focus only on what went well
   - ✅ Discuss failures, mistakes, and what you learned from them

4. **Pattern Recognition** - Not isolated events
   - ❌ "I did X, then Y, then Z"
   - ✅ "I noticed a pattern where I struggle with delegation, which affected projects X, Y, and Z"

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- ❌ **Chronological narrative** - "First I did this, then I did that..."
- ❌ **Vague generalizations** - "I learned valuable lessons"
- ❌ **Only discussing successes** - Ignoring failures and challenges
- ❌ **Lack of self-awareness** - Not recognizing privilege or mistakes
- ❌ **Superficial description** - Not explaining WHY things happened

### Outstanding vs. First-Class

| Aspect | First-Class (70-79%) | Outstanding (90-100%) |
|--------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Depth | Good description of experiences | Deep analysis of WHY and HOW |
| Failures | Mentioned but briefly | Discussed honestly with learning extracted |
| Self-awareness | Some recognition of strengths | High awareness of both strengths AND weaknesses |
| Patterns | Limited connection between events | Clear identification of behavioural patterns |
| Critical evaluation | Some evaluation present | Consistent critical analysis throughout |
