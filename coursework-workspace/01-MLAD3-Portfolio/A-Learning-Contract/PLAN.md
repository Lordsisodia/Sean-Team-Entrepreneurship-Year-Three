# Learning Contract Improvement Plan

**Created:** January 20, 2026
**Target:** 90-100% (Outstanding) across all Learning Contract sections
**Status:** Phase 0 - Gather Context (First Step)

---

## Overview

This plan documents our systematic approach to improving the Learning Contract from its current state (~75-80%, Strong First-Class) to 90-100% (Outstanding). We will follow a **four-phase** process:

1. **Phase 0: Gather Context** ⬅️ **WE ARE HERE**
   - Import Year 2 coursework and feedback
   - Analyze what was submitted and how it was graded
   - Extract learnings to apply to Year 3

2. **Phase 1: Harsh Marking Assessment**
   - Apply 90-100% criteria rigorously to identify gaps
   - Compare Year 3 content against Year 2 feedback

3. **Phase 2: Feedback Synthesis**
   - Compile Year 2 feedback + new assessment into improvement requirements
   - Prioritize by impact on final grade

4. **Phase 3: Implementation**
   - Execute improvements with user input
   - Create v02, v03 as needed

---

## 🎯 Phase 0: Gather Year 2 Context (Current Priority)

### Why This is Critical

Before we can properly assess and improve Year 3, we need to understand:
1. **What you actually submitted in Year 2** - Your baseline work
2. **What feedback you received** - What markers liked/disliked
3. **What grade you achieved** - What worked, what didn't
4. **What patterns to repeat/avoid** - Learn from past performance

### What We Need From You

**Item 1: Year 2 Coursework Content**
- Please paste your Year 2 Learning Contract content into a TXT file
- Save as: `YEAR-2-COURSEWORK.txt` in this folder
- Include all sections you submitted

**Item 2: Year 2 Feedback Files**
- Please share all feedback files from Year 2
- These could be:
  - Marking sheets with grades/comments
  - Tutor feedback documents
  - Peer review feedback
  - Any written feedback you received
- Save these files in a `YEAR-2-FEEDBACK/` folder I'll create

**Item 3: Year 2 Grade Information**
- What was your final Year 2 grade?
- Any specific comments from markers about what to improve?

### What I Will Do Once You Provide This

1. **Analyze Year 2 Content**
   - Identify writing patterns you used
   - Note what worked well (strengths to maintain)
   - Note what didn't work (weaknesses to address)

2. **Extract Year 2 Feedback Insights**
   - What did markers praise? (do more of this)
   - What did markers criticize? (fix these issues)
   - What specific suggestions were made?

3. **Compare Year 2 vs Year 3**
   - Are you making the same mistakes?
   - Have you addressed previous feedback?
   - What's the progression/growth?

4. **Update the Harsh Assessment**
   - Refine our harsh marking based on Year 2 learnings
   - Ensure we don't repeat Year 2 errors

## Action Items (Phase 0)

### For You (User):
- [ ] Create `YEAR-2-COURSEWORK.txt` with your Year 2 Learning Contract
- [ ] Gather all Year 2 feedback files
- [ ] Note your Year 2 final grade and any key feedback
- [ ] Let me know when files are ready

### For Me (Claude):
- [ ] Create `YEAR-2-FEEDBACK/` folder for feedback files
- [ ] Read and analyze `YEAR-2-COURSEWORK.txt`
- [ ] Read and analyze all feedback files
- [ ] Extract key insights and patterns
- [ ] Update harsh assessment with Year 2 context
- [ ] Create refined improvement checklist

---

## What Happens After Phase 0

Once we understand your Year 2 work and feedback:

1. **We'll see patterns** - What you consistently do well vs what needs work
2. **We'll avoid repeating mistakes** - Fix issues that carried over from Year 2
3. **We'll build on strengths** - Double down on what markers liked
4. **We'll have context** - Understand your growth trajectory from Year 1 → Year 2 → Year 3

This makes Phase 1 (Harsh Assessment) much more accurate and targeted.

---

## Quick Reference: What We're Looking For in Year 2

### Positive Patterns to Continue:
- Specific examples over general statements
- Honest discussion of failures
- Critical evaluation (not just description)
- Clear connections between sections
- Evidence-based claims

### Negative Patterns to Avoid:
- Chronological narrative ("then I did this...")
- Superficial claims without evidence
- Vague self-assessment
- Only discussing successes
- Disconnected sections

### From Year 2 Feedback, We Want to Know:
- Were you marked down for word count issues?
- Did markers want more critical evaluation?
- Were your examples specific enough?
- Did you show enough self-awareness?
- What was the main thing preventing higher marks?

---

## Next Steps

1. **You:** Gather your Year 2 coursework and feedback files
2. **You:** Create `YEAR-2-COURSEWORK.txt` and put feedback files in `YEAR-2-FEEDBACK/`
3. **You:** Let me know when everything is ready
4. **Me:** Analyze everything and update the plan with Year 2 insights
5. **Us:** Move to Phase 1 with full context

---

## Phase 1: Harsh Marking Assessment

### What We're Doing

Applying the 90-100% Outstanding marking criteria from the marking scheme to each section, treating the current content as if we were a harsh marker grading it against Outstanding standards.

### Assessment Framework (90-100% Criteria)

**For Q1-Q4 (Evidence of Self-Managed Learning - 60%):**
- ALL components complete according to instructions
- Significant effort evident
- Detailed responses (not superficial)
- In-depth critical evaluation (not just description)
- High self-awareness and personal accountability
- Specific examples and honest reflection

**For Q5 (Final Analysis - 40%):**
- In-depth critical evaluation of Self-leadership activities
- Key learning about personal habits and behaviours
- High levels of self-awareness
- High levels of personal accountability
- Consideration of plans vs reality
- Critically informed judgment
- Significant future plans

### Section-by-Section Assessment

---

#### Q1: Where Have I Been? (Target: 500 words)

**Current Status:** v01 exists, 519 words ✅

**90-100% Criteria Applied:**

| Criterion | Expected | Current | Gap |
|-----------|----------|--------|-----|
| Specific Year 1/2 experiences | Concrete examples with details | ✅ 5 learning moments documented | - |
| Critical reflection | WHY and HOW, not just WHAT | ⚠️ Mostly description | Needs more analysis |
| Honest self-assessment | Privilege, mistakes acknowledged | ✅ Some honesty | Could be deeper |
| Patterns in behaviour | Connections across experiences | ❌ Not explicitly stated | Needs identification |
| Connection to current | How past led to now | ⚠️ Implied | Make explicit |

**Harsh Grade Estimate:** 72% (First-Class)

**Why not 90%+:**
- Lacks explicit behavioral pattern identification
- More descriptive than evaluative (tells WHAT happened, not WHY it matters)
- Limited connection between experiences and current capabilities
- Could be more honest about failures (focuses on successes)

**Improvement Required:**
1. Add explicit pattern identification: "Across these experiences, I notice a recurring pattern where..."
2. Deepen critical evaluation: "This wasn't just a success; it revealed that I..."
3. Strengthen failures discussion: Add a specific Year 2 failure with learning
4. Make current connection explicit: "These experiences shaped my current capability in X by..."

---

#### Q2: Where Am I Now? (Target: 500-800 words)

**Current Status:** v01 exists, word count TBD

**90-100% Criteria Applied:**

| Criterion | Expected | Current | Gap |
|-----------|----------|--------|-----|
| Psychometric integration | Results applied to behaviour | ⚠️ Present but could be deeper | Connect more specifically |
| Honest strengths AND weaknesses | Both clearly articulated | ✅ 6 strengths, 6 challenges | - |
| Current capabilities | Clearly articulated | ⚠| Could be more specific |
| Values and drivers | Explicitly stated | ⚠️ Needs more clarity | Make explicit |
| Recognition of gaps | What's missing | ⚠️ Present | - |

**Harsh Grade Estimate:** 70-75% (First-Class)

**Why not 90%+:**
- Psychometric results listed but not deeply integrated into behaviour analysis
- Values/drivers mentioned but not clearly connected to goals
- Could be more specific about current capability LEVELS (not just presence/absence)
- Needs more evidence of HOW psychometric traits manifest in actual work

**Improvement Required:**
1. Deepen psychometric integration: "My INTJ preference for strategic thinking manifests in X situation by..."
2. Make values/drivers explicit and connect to Q3 goals
3. Add specific examples showing traits in action: "When I [situation], my [trait] caused [outcome]"
4. Be more specific about current capability levels: "I am currently at 6/10 in X because..."

---

#### Q3: Where Do I Want To Get To? (Target: 300 words)

**Current Status:** v01 exists, word count TBD

**90-100% Criteria Applied:**

| Criterion | Expected | Current | Gap |
|-----------|----------|--------|-----|
| Clear exit strategy | Specific outcomes | TBD | To assess |
| Ambitious but achievable | Challenging, realistic | TBD | To assess |
| Connected to psychometric (Q2) | Uses Q2 insights | TBD | To assess |
| Aligned to values/drivers | Matches what matters | TBD | To assess |
| Market context validation | Evidence of viability | TBD | To assess |
| Strategic thinking evident | Rationale clear | TBD | To assess |

**Note:** This section needs content review before harsh grading.

---

#### Q4: How Will I Get There? (Target: 500 words)

**Current Status:** v01 exists, word count TBD

**90-100% Criteria Applied:**

| Criterion | Expected | Current | Gap |
|-----------|----------|--------|-----|
| 6 competencies from TE Framework | Properly identified | ✅ Listed | Verify each is TE Framework |
| Current levels honest | Not inflated | ⚠️ Needs verification | Check realism |
| Target levels ambitious | Challenging but doable | ⚠️ Needs verification | Check progression |
| Connect to exit strategy | Supports Q3 | TBD | To assess |
| Specific actions for each | Concrete steps | ⚠️ Needs verification | Check specificity |
| Timeline established | When things happen | ⚠️ Needs verification | Check dates |
| Mix of competency areas | Not all same category | TBD | To assess |

**Note:** This section needs content review before harsh grading.

---

#### Competencies (Year 2 and Year 3)

**Current Status:** v01 exists for both

**90-100% Criteria Applied:**

| Criterion | Expected | Current | Gap |
|-----------|----------|--------|-----|
| From UWE TE Framework | Proper codes/identifiers | ⚠️ Needs verification | Confirm TE Framework |
| Evidence provided | Specific examples | ⚠️ Needs verification | Check evidence quality |
| Realistic current levels | Honest assessment | ⚠️ Needs verification | Check for inflation |
| Challenging target levels | Ambitious | ⚠️ Needs verification | Check progression |
| Connected to goals | Supports exit strategy | TBD | To assess |

**Note:** These sections need content review before harsh grading.

## Phase 2: Feedback Synthesis

### Critical Issues (Must Fix for 90%+)

**Issue 1: Description vs. Critical Evaluation**
- **Problem:** Content tends to describe WHAT happened rather than evaluating WHY it matters
- **Impact:** Prevents "in-depth critical evaluation" required for 90-100%
- **Fix Required:** Add analysis sentences starting with "This reveals that..." "This demonstrates..." "The significance is..."

**Issue 2: Pattern Identification Missing**
- **Problem:** Experiences treated as isolated events, not connected into behavioural patterns
- **Impact:** Misses "key learning about personal habits and behaviours"
- **Fix Required:** Add pattern statements: "Across X, Y, Z, I notice a consistent pattern where..."

**Issue 3: Values/Drivers Not Explicit**
- **Problem:** What motivates you is implied but not clearly stated
- **Impact:** Weakens connection to Q3 exit strategy
- **Fix Required:** Add explicit values statement: "My core values are X, Y, Z because..."

**Issue 4: Psychometric Integration Could Be Deeper**
- **Problem:** Assessment results listed but not deeply connected to actual behaviour
- **Impact:** Misses opportunity to show self-awareness
- **Fix Required:** For each trait, add: "This manifests in my work when I [specific situation]..."

**Issue 5: Failures Could Be More Honest**
- **Problem:** Focuses more on successes than failures
- **Impact:** Reduces "personal accountability" demonstration
- **Fix Required:** Add 1-2 specific Year 2 failures with what you learned

### Enhancement Opportunities (Good to Have)

**Opportunity 1: Academic References**
- Add 3-5 academic references per section
- Connect to theory: Kolb, Gibbs, Schön, Dweck, etc.
- Strengthens "critically informed judgment"

**Opportunity 2: Specific Examples**
- Replace general statements with specific examples
- Add numbers, dates, names where appropriate
- Strengthens "detailed responses"

**Opportunity 3: Word Count Precision**
- Verify all sections are within target ranges
- Adjust to optimal sweet spots (not just within tolerance)
