## Marking Criteria (90-100% Outstanding)

### What Assessors Are Looking For

1. **Specific Strengths** - Not generic
   - ❌ "I'm a good communicator"
   - ✅ "My INTJ strategic thinking enables me to see systems and opportunities others miss"

2. **Evidence-Based** - Real examples
   - ❌ "I'm good at problem-solving"
   - ✅ "I identified the agency model opportunity and developed the Partnership Framework in 4 weeks"

3. **Self-Aware of Shadow Side** - Not blind to downsides
   - ❌ Only positive aspects
   - ✅ "My strategic strength means I can get stuck in analysis paralysis, delaying action"

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- ❌ Generic strengths anyone could claim
- ❌ No evidence/examples
- ❌ No awareness of shadow side
- ❌ Disconnected from actual work
