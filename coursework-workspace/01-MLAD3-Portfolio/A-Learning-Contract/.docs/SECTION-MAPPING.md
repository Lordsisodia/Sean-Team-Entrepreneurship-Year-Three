**Contains:**
- List of 6 competencies from UWE TE Framework
- Current level (0-10 scale)
- Target level (0-10 scale)
- Connection to exit strategy

**Builds On:**
- Competencies Developed (#02) - Year Two foundation

---

### 09. Where Did I Get To
**PebblePad:** Q5 - Where did I get to?
**Focus:** Final analysis (due April 2026), evaluation of learning journey

**Contains:**
