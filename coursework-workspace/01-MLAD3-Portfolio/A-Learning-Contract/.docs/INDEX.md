## Documentation Standards

### Version Convention
- Format: `vXX` (zero-padded, e.g., v01, v02, v03)
- Always start with v01
- Increment by 1 for each new draft incorporating feedback
- Tag final version as `vXX-final`

### File Naming
- Draft content: `versions/vXX/draft.md`
- Feedback: `versions/vXX/feedback.md`
- Metadata: `versions/vXX/metadata.json`

### Status Values
- `draft` - Initial version, not yet reviewed
- `under-review` - Awaiting feedback
- `revising` - Incorporating feedback
- `complete` - Final version, no further changes needed
