## How I Evaluate Feedback Quality

I assess all feedback using these criteria:

1. **Relevance:** Does this align with my Year Three goals and exit strategy?
2. **Specificity:** Is the feedback actionable and concrete, or vague and general?
3. **Evidence-Based:** Is it grounded in observable behaviors/outcomes or assumptions?
4. **Developmental:** Does it challenge me to grow beyond current capabilities?
5. **Practical:** Can I realistically implement this within my 9-month timeline?

I do NOT automatically accept all feedback. Instead, I:
- Question assumptions behind the input
- Consider alternative perspectives
- Weigh against my self-knowledge (INTJ analytical strengths, Learning Styles 114, etc.)
- Test validity against business realities and market conditions
- Make informed decisions about what to adopt, adapt, or respectfully decline

## Feedback Sources Framework

### Primary Sources (Formal Academic)
- Module Tutor - Formative assessments and academic guidance
- Team Company Director - Professional development reviews
- Workshop Facilitators - Session-specific learning insights

### Secondary Sources (Peer & Self)
- TE Cohort Peers - Collaborative feedback sessions
- Team Apollo Members - Operational feedback on leadership/delegation
- Self-Assessment - Regular portfolio reviews against criteria

### External Sources (Industry Context)
- Business Mentors - Real-world entrepreneurial guidance
- Client Feedback - Market validation of skills/approach
- Industry Advisors - Sector-specific expertise

---

## Response Action Categories

When feedback is validated as valuable, I take one of these action types:

1. **Immediate Portfolio Update** - Modify existing sections (documented in Change Log)
2. **Learning Plan Adjustment** - Revise SMART Objectives or Evidence of Learning
3. **Competency Development** - Add/refine competency development activities
4. **Research/Investigation** - Deeper exploration of identified knowledge gaps
5. **Stakeholder Engagement** - Discuss with relevant parties for clarity
6. **Future Monitoring** - Track over time for pattern recognition

## Critical Reflection on Feedback Process

### What I've Learned About Receiving Feedback:
[To be completed throughout module - will reflect on:]
- How my INTJ preference for logic affects my reception of emotional/relationship feedback
- The difference between feedback that confirms vs challenges my self-perception
- When to trust external input vs my analytical assessment
- How power dynamics (tutor, director) influence my openness to criticism

### How I've Developed My Response Strategy:
[To be completed - will document evolution of:]
- Initial defensive reactions → constructive evaluation
- Passive acceptance → critical analysis
- Isolated decision-making → stakeholder consultation where appropriate
