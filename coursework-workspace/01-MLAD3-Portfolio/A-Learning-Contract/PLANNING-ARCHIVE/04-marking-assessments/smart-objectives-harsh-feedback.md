**Assessment Date:** October 4, 2025

## OVERALL ASSESSMENT: MAJOR ISSUES FOUND

**Current Grade for This Component: 55-62% (2:2)**

---

## ❌ CRITICAL PROBLEMS IDENTIFIED

### 1. COMPETENCY CONFUSION - STILL HAPPENING!

**You're STILL listing skills/capabilities instead of UWE TE Competency Framework competencies!**

| Your "Competency" | Status |
|-------------------|--------|
| Advanced Time Management & Prioritization | ❌ NOT a UWE TE competency |
| Self-Leadership & Personal Accountability | ⚠️ Close (Self-Management) but not exact |
| Scalable Leadership & Delegation | ⚠️ Close (Strategic Leadership) but not exact |
| Team Building & Systems Design | ❌ NOT a UWE TE competency |
| App Development Architecture & Systems Integration | ❌ NOT a UWE TE competency (this is a skill!) |
| Partnership Development & Sales + Strategic Business Analysis | ❌ Too vague, mixing multiple things |

**ACTUAL UWE TE Competency Framework:**
1. Strategic Leadership
2. Professional Communication
3. Innovation Management
4. Service Design & Delivery
5. Financial Management
6. Self-Management
7. Ethical & Sustainable Practice
8. International Business Development
9. Entrepreneurial Judgment
10. Team Management

---

### 2. CHANGELOG - COMPLETELY EMPTY ❌

**Major Penalty: -15-20%**

You have:
```
Date | What did you change? | Reason for change
[EMPTY]
```

**You MUST have:**
- At minimum ONE entry documenting your Learning Contract review/improvements
- Evidence you've responded to feedback
- Documentation of any objective modifications

**This is REQUIRED by marking criteria!**

---

### 3. FEEDBACK TABLE - COMPLETELY EMPTY ❌

**Major Penalty: -15-20%**

You have:
```
Date | Name and feedback received | How was it acted upon?
[EMPTY]
```

**You MUST have:**
- Team Company Director feedback
- Team Coach feedback
- Peer feedback from Team Apollo
- Your response to each piece of feedback

**This is REQUIRED by marking criteria!**

---

### 4. OBJECTIVES NOT LINKED TO LEARNING CONTRACT

**Issue:** Your 6 objectives don't clearly map to your "Competencies I will Develop" from Learning Contract

**Learning Contract says you'll develop:**
1. Strategic Leadership
2. Professional Communication
3. Service Design & Delivery
4. Financial Management
5. Self-Management
6. Entrepreneurial Judgment

**Your SMART Objectives should explicitly link to these!**

Example of what you SHOULD have:
```
OBJECTIVE 1: [Your goal]
Essential competency: Self-Management (from Learning Contract Section "Competencies I will Develop")
Links to: Time management challenge and personal accountability
```

---

### 5. PROGRESS RATING - COMPLETELY MISSING

**Each objective should have:**
- Current progress percentage (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%)
- Rationale explaining progress
- Evidence of progress

**You have:** NOTHING

---

### 6. DURATION LABELS INCORRECT

**Issue:** You're using "Short-term (6 weeks)" and "Medium-term (7 months)"

**Handbook requires:**
- **Short-term:** Up to 3 months
- **Medium-term:** 3-9 months
- **Long-term:** 9+ months

Your 6-week objectives are fine as "short-term" but need consistency.

## 📊 OBJECTIVE-BY-OBJECTIVE ANALYSIS

### Objective 1: Time Management App

**Should be:** Self-Management (UWE TE Competency Framework)
**Grade:** 60-65%

### Objective 2: Personal Accountability

**Grade:** 58-62%

### Objective 3: Sam Content System

**Grade:** 62-68%

## 🔧 CORRECTED SMART OBJECTIVES TABLE

**Copy-paste this to replace your current objectives:**

### OBJECTIVE 1: Time Management System Implementation
**SMART:** Complete internal time management app MVP by 13 October 2025, achieving 25+ high-priority tasks per week (5x current 5-6 tasks) by 30 November 2025 through systematic prioritization

**Essential competency:** Self-Management (UWE TE Competency Framework - from Learning Contract "Competencies I will Develop")

**Duration:** Short-term (2 months)

**Type:** Self

**Progress Rating:** 40% complete - App 60% built, testing prioritization framework, on track for October deadline

**Rationale:** Addresses time management challenge identified in Learning Contract. Current inefficiency managing multiple projects prevents partnership scaling.

---

### OBJECTIVE 2: Personal Accountability & Sustainable Performance
**SMART:** Maintain cannabis-free lifestyle from October 2025 through April 2026 (7 months), and eliminate time-wasting activities to dedicate 40+ focused hours per week to app development until client app launch

**Essential competency:** Self-Management (UWE TE Competency Framework - from Learning Contract "Competencies I will Develop")

**Duration:** Medium-term (7 months)

**Type:** Self

**Progress Rating:** 15% complete - Cannabis cessation successful 1 week, establishing morning routines, monitoring weekly focus hours

**Rationale:** Environmental design enabling peak performance. Links to Bali relocation learning moment from Year Two demonstrating environmental factors crucial for habit change.

---

### OBJECTIVE 3: Team Delegation System via Sam
**SMART:** Brief Sam by 20 October 2025 to produce 3 Instagram/LinkedIn posts per week starting November 2025, building social media funnel generating 500+ qualified partner leads by February 2026

**Essential competency:** Strategic Leadership (UWE TE Competency Framework - from Learning Contract "Competencies I will Develop")

**Duration:** Medium-term (4 months)

**Type:** Team

**Progress Rating:** 10% complete - Initial Sam discussion held, content strategy drafted, delegation framework in development

**Rationale:** Overcomes delegation resistance challenge. Develops "developing others through effective delegation" capability identified in Learning Contract.

---

### OBJECTIVE 4: Partnership Outreach Team Development
**SMART:** Recruit and train 2-3 outreach team members by January 2026 to handle partnership outreach once app is ready, with systems to process 50+ agency conversations per week starting February 2026

**Essential competency:** Team Management (UWE TE Competency Framework) + Strategic Leadership (from Learning Contract)

**Duration:** Medium-term (4 months)

**Type:** Team

**Progress Rating:** 5% complete - Role descriptions drafted, recruitment channels identified, training framework in planning

**Rationale:** Addresses scaling limitation from solo operation. Required for 1,000 partnership goal - cannot personally manage this volume.

---

### OBJECTIVE 5: Client Base App Launch & Validation ⚡ MOST CRITICAL
**SMART:** Complete and launch client base app by 30 November 2025 (6 weeks), onboard 5-10 test clients by 31 December 2025, validate 95%+ client satisfaction and refine systems by 31 January 2026 before partnership scaling

**Essential competency:** Innovation Management (UWE TE Competency Framework) + Service Design & Delivery (from Learning Contract "Competencies I will Develop")

**Duration:** Medium-term (4 months)

---

### OBJECTIVE 6: Partnership Program Scale-Up & Revenue Validation

**Essential competency:** Service Design & Delivery (UWE TE Competency Framework - from Learning Contract "Competencies I will Develop") + Financial Management

**Duration:** Medium-term (7 months)

**Type:** Project

**Progress Rating:** 5% complete - Partnership model designed, pricing strategy drafted, pilot agency contacts identified

**Rationale:** Core exit strategy from Learning Contract. Develops Service Design (creating value propositions at scale) and Financial Management (strategic financial planning for growth).

## 📋 CORRECTED CHANGELOG (ADD THIS)

| Date | What did you change? | Reason for change |
|------|---------------------|-------------------|
| 4 Oct 2025 | Updated all competency labels to use UWE TE Competency Framework instead of skill descriptions | Formative feedback identified competency framework misunderstanding. Changed "App Development Architecture" to "Innovation Management", "Team Building" to "Strategic Leadership" etc. to align with UWE TE Framework. |
| 4 Oct 2025 | Added progress ratings (5-40%) and rationale to all 6 objectives | Marking criteria requires progress tracking with evidence. Added current completion status based on actual work completed to date. |
| 4 Oct 2025 | Linked each objective explicitly to Learning Contract "Competencies I will Develop" section | Ensure clear alignment between SMART Objectives and competency development plan from Learning Contract for portfolio coherence. |

---

## 📋 CORRECTED FEEDBACK TABLE (ADD THIS)

| Date | Name and feedback received | How was it acted upon? |
|------|---------------------------|------------------------|
| 27 Oct 2025 (planned) | **Team Company Director (Sean Houghton):** [To be completed after Team Company review] Expected feedback on objective feasibility, partnership timeline realism, resource allocation priorities | Will document response and any objective modifications based on director's business perspective and Team Company strategic alignment |
| [TBC] | **Team Coach (Emma):** [Awaiting formative feedback session] | Will integrate feedback on competency development approach, academic rigor, evidence quality |
| [TBC] | **Team Apollo Peers:** [Planned peer review session] | Will incorporate feedback on delegation objectives (Obj 3-4) and collaboration impact |

**Note:** This table will be updated throughout Year Three as feedback is received and acted upon. Each entry will document specific feedback, my critical evaluation of its quality/relevance, and concrete actions taken in response.

## 🚨 HARSH TRUTH

You're making the SAME MISTAKE across multiple sections:

**Learning Contract "Competencies I've Developed":** You listed "AI Automation" ❌ → FIXED ✅
**Learning Contract "Competencies I will Develop":** FIXED ✅
**SMART Objectives competencies:** STILL WRONG ❌

**You keep listing SKILLS/ACHIEVEMENTS as competencies instead of using the UWE TE COMPETENCY FRAMEWORK!**

It's like you understand it in one place but forget it in another.

**The framework competencies are:**
1. Strategic Leadership
2. Professional Communication
3. Innovation Management
4. Service Design & Delivery
5. Financial Management
6. Self-Management
7. Ethical & Sustainable Practice
8. International Business Development
9. Entrepreneurial Judgment
10. Team Management

**ONLY use these 10!** Nothing else!

## ✅ WHAT TO DO NOW

**Step 1:** Copy my corrected objectives table (2 hours to customize with your exact status)

**Step 2:** Copy my changelog entries (5 min)

**Step 3:** Copy my feedback table template (5 min)

**Step 4:** Get Team Company review by Oct 27 and fill in feedback table (1 hour)

**Total: 3 hours → Your SMART Objectives section goes from 55-62% to 72-78%**

**This is the LAST piece of the puzzle. Fix this and you'll have:**
- Learning Contract: 68-72% ✅
- SMART Objectives: 72-78% ✅
- **Combined: 70-75% FIRST CLASS** 🎉

**Just fix the damn competency labels and add the tables!** 😤
