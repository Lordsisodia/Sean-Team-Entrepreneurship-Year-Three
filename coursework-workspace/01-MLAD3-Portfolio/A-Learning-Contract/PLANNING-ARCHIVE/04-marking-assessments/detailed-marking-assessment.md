**Date:** October 2025
**Student:** Shaan Sisodia
**Assessment:** Portfolio of Self-Leadership (60% of MLAD3)

---

## OVERALL GRADE ESTIMATE: 65-68 (Solid 2:1)

**Critical Observation:** You have strong content and authentic experiences, but you're missing key elements required for 90-100% (Outstanding) performance based on the official marking criteria.

---

## SECTION-BY-SECTION DETAILED ASSESSMENT

### Evidence of Self-Managed Learning (60% of Portfolio Grade)

**Official Criteria for 90-100% (Outstanding):**
> "All or most components of the Portfolio of Self-leadership have been completed according to assignment instructions. Significant effort has been made showing detailed responses to the Learning Contract questions, Change Log and Feedback and Response."

**Your Current Status:**

✅ **What You Have:**
- 8 of 9 Learning Contract sections completed (Final Analysis pending - appropriate for timeline)
- Detailed responses to all current questions
- Strong word count discipline (mostly at or under limits)
- Authentic, specific examples throughout

❌ **What You're MISSING (Critical for Outstanding):**

**1. Change Log** - NOT PRESENT
- Official requirement: "Changes to your Objectives and Learning Contract are recorded in the Change Log"
- You need to document any changes made to objectives throughout the year
- Even if no changes yet, you need a Change Log section showing you understand the requirement

**2. Feedback & Response Table** - NOT PRESENT
- Official requirement: "3 Team Company Reviews of your Objectives, including peer feedback with your responses"
- Must show:
  - Feedback received from minimum 2 team members per review
  - Your responses to that feedback
  - What you agreed/disagreed with
  - What you changed as a result

**3. Activity Log Approvals** - NOT PRESENT
- Official requirement: "8 Monthly Activity Log Approvals from your Team Company, supported with activity logs for each month"
- Need spreadsheet tracker showing:
  - Monthly LbD and LfO activities (minimum 2 each)
  - Team Company approval/non-approval
  - Second chance process if work not done

**4. Team Company Review Evidence** - NOT DOCUMENTED
- Official requirement from Appendix 1: "Team Company to provide feedback using criterion:
  - Are the objectives SMART?
  - Is there alignment to Learning Contract ambitions and competencies?
  - Are these objectives appropriate to the team's direction?
  - Are the objectives ambitious enough for the individual and year level?"

**Impact on Grade:** Missing these components caps your grade at approximately **68-70% maximum** even if content quality is Outstanding.

### Final Analysis (40% of Portfolio Grade)

**Official Criteria for 90-100% (Outstanding):**
> "An in-depth critical evaluation of how Self-leadership activities have led to key learning about personal habits and behaviours, demonstrating high levels of self-awareness and personal accountability. Evaluation includes consideration of what your plans were and where you reached. Critically informed judgment has led to significant future plans based on this reflection."

**Your Current Status:**

✅ **Appropriately Pending** - Due April 2026

✅ **Good Planning** - Your placeholder shows you understand what's required:
- In-depth critical evaluation
- High self-awareness demonstration
- Plans vs. reality assessment
- Future planning based on reflection
- Learning integration (LbD, LfO, Competency)

⚠️ **Future Risk Areas to Watch:**
When you write this in April, ensure you include:
- Specific quantified outcomes (actual partnership numbers vs. 1,000 goal)
- Critical evaluation of failures, not just successes
- Personal accountability for shortcomings
- Intrinsic AND extrinsic factors affecting outcomes
- Links back to Learning Contract desires (show how well you predicted your needs)

---

## CONTENT QUALITY ASSESSMENT (What's Actually Written)

### Section 1: Where Have I Been? (497/500 words)

**Official Criteria Check:**
- ✅ "Evaluate 5 key learning moments from year 2" - DONE
- ✅ "Identify behaviours, habits and mindsets" - DONE
- ✅ "Consider the impact you have had on others" - DONE

**Current Grade: 72-75 (First-Class, but could be higher)**

**Strengths:**
- Specific, quantified examples (75 AI agents, $100K savings)
- Clear behavior changes identified
- Impact on others mentioned for each moment
- Honest assessment including weaknesses

**What's Missing for 90%:**

❌ **Lack of Comparative Analysis**
- No Year One vs Year Two comparison showing progression
- Missing "where I started" vs "where I am now" framing
- Example: "Year One I would have... Year Two I learned to..."

❌ **Insufficient Critical Evaluation**
- Too much description of achievements, not enough analysis of learning
- Missing "what I got wrong" and "what I'd do differently"
- Need more vulnerability about failures

❌ **Limited Self-Management Focus**
- You describe project success but don't always connect to self-management learning
- Example: "75 AI agents" is impressive - but what did you learn about YOUR habits/discipline/time management?

**Example of What's Missing:**

**Current (Descriptive):**
> "The first major breakthrough came when I successfully deployed 75 specialized AI agents across client workflows."

**Outstanding Level (Reflective + Comparative):**
> "Year One, I'd build each solution from scratch, treating every client as unique. This felt sophisticated but was actually inefficient. Year Two's breakthrough came when I forced myself to build 75 reusable agents instead. The self-management lesson wasn't the technical achievement - it was learning to tolerate the 'boring' work of documentation and templates. I discovered my bias toward novelty undermines scaling. This pattern of preferring 'exciting new problems' over 'systematic solutions' is my core self-management weakness."

**To Reach 85-90%:**
1. Add Year One vs Year Two comparison to each learning moment (50 words)
2. Include "what I got wrong" for each moment (30 words)
3. Reframe from project success → self-management insight (revise 100 words)

---

### Section 2: Year Two Competencies Developed

**Official Criteria Check:**
- ✅ "List 6 competencies that you developed during year 2" - DONE
- ✅ "Provide a rationale for why you developed these competencies" - DONE
- ✅ "Refer to the competency framework that you used" - DONE (mentions "Framework Connection")

**Current Grade: 78-82 (Strong First-Class)**

**Strengths:**
- Clear rationale for each competency
- Specific evidence provided
- Explicit Framework Connection listed
- Appropriate mix across self/team/project domains

**What's Missing for 90%:**

❌ **Lack of UWE TE Competency Framework Explicit Language**
- You mention "Framework Connection: Innovation Management" but don't cite the actual UWE TE Competency Framework
- Need to explicitly state: "According to UWE TE Competency Framework, this develops [specific competency area]"
- Should reference competency progression levels if applicable

❌ **Missing Comparative Evidence**
- No before/after demonstration
- Missing competency level progression (e.g., "Developed from Level 2 to Level 4")

❌ **Limited Integration with Year One**
- Doesn't show how these build on Year One competencies
- Missing the progression narrative

**To Reach 90%:**
1. Add explicit UWE TE Competency Framework references with competency levels (20 words per competency)
2. Show progression from Year One to Year Two capability level
3. Reference competency tracking evidence if you have it

---

### Section 3: Where Am I Now? (796/800 words)

**Official Criteria Check:**
- ✅ "Refer to 4 psychometric assessments completed for year 3" - DONE (you have 6)
- ✅ "Provide an analysis of your personality based on previous and current psychometric assessments" - DONE
- ✅ "Justify more than 3 personal values that define your ability to self-manage" - DONE (you have 3)

**Current Grade: 80-85 (Strong First-Class)**

**Strengths:**
- Integration across 6 psychometric assessments (exceeds requirement)
- Clear connection to Year Three challenges
- Honest assessment of weaknesses (low agreeableness)
- Strong personal values justification
- Excellent self-awareness demonstration

**What's Missing for 90%:**

❌ **No Previous vs Current Psychometric Comparison**
- Official criteria says "based on previous and current psychometric assessments"
- You only discuss current Year Three assessments
- Missing: "In Year One, my learning style assessment showed X. Year Three shows evolution to Y."

❌ **Limited Academic Grounding**
- No citations for psychometric assessment research
- Missing theoretical framework references (e.g., Big 5 research, MBTI validity studies)
- No academic sources on self-leadership or personality

❌ **Surface-Level Integration in Places**
- Some sections describe assessment results without deep analysis of implications
- Missing "so what?" - how does this specifically change your behavior?

**Example of What's Missing:**

**Current:**
> "My Big 5 assessment revealed high openness to experience and notably low agreeableness."

**Outstanding (with academic grounding + implication):**
> "My Big 5 assessment revealed high openness to experience and notably low agreeableness. Research by Judge et al. (2002) found that while high openness predicts entrepreneurial success, low agreeableness can limit leadership effectiveness in collaborative contexts - precisely the challenge I face with partnership development. This means I must deliberately practice relationship-preserving communication, not because it's 'nice,' but because it's a documented success factor for collaborative ventures."

❌ **Only 3 Values (Meets Minimum, Not Exceeding)**
- "More than 3 personal values" suggests 4-5 would be stronger
- Could add 1-2 more values with self-management connection

**To Reach 90%:**
1. Add Year One vs Year Three psychometric comparison (100 words)
2. Include 3-5 academic citations for personality/learning theory (integrate throughout)
3. Add 1-2 more personal values (50 words each)
4. Deepen "so what?" implications for each assessment finding

---

### Section 4: Strengths (6 with Value Examples)

**Official Criteria Check:**
- ✅ "List 6 of your strengths" - DONE
- ✅ "Provide examples of how these are of value to you and/or others" - DONE

**Current Grade: 75-78 (Good First-Class)**

**Strengths:**
- Specific quantified examples for each
- Clear value to self and others articulated
- Mix of technical and personal strengths
- Evidence from Year Two achievements

**What's Missing for 90%:**

❌ **Uneven "Value to Others" Depth**
- Some strengths have strong "value to others" (High-Stakes Client Management)
- Others are more focused on "value to self" (Autonomous Execution)
- Need balanced coverage for each

❌ **Missing "When This Becomes a Weakness" Analysis**
- Outstanding portfolios show awareness that strengths can be overused
- Example: "Autonomous Execution is a strength, but becomes isolation when I avoid necessary collaboration"

❌ **Limited Connection to Year Three Goals**
- Doesn't explicitly show how each strength will support 1,000 partnership goal
- Missing strategic relevance to exit strategy

❌ **No Stakeholder Perspective**
- All observations are your perspective
- Outstanding work would include: "Team Company feedback confirms this strength: [quote/evidence]"

**Example of What's Missing:**

**Current:**
> **1. Rapid Technical Learning & Skill Acquisition**
> - Value to Others: Team Company can confidently commit to projects in unfamiliar technical domains

**Outstanding (with weakness recognition + stakeholder view + strategic relevance):**
> **1. Rapid Technical Learning & Skill Acquisition**
> - Value to Others: Team Company can confidently commit to projects in unfamiliar technical domains. Sam's feedback: "Knowing Shaan will figure it out means we can say yes to complex opportunities."
> - When This Becomes Weakness: My confidence in rapid learning sometimes leads me to underestimate project complexity. The Nigerian crypto project took 3 weeks instead of predicted 2 weeks because I assumed blockchain would be "just another API."
> - Year Three Strategic Relevance: This strength will enable me to quickly learn B2B sales methodologies and partnership frameworks, critical for the 1,000 agency goal. However, I must avoid the trap of thinking "I'll figure out sales quickly" without deliberate practice.

**To Reach 90%:**
1. Balance "value to self" and "value to others" for all 6 strengths (add 20 words each)
2. Add "when this becomes a weakness" for each strength (30 words each)
3. Include stakeholder quotes/feedback for 3-4 strengths (20 words each)
4. Explicitly connect each to Year Three exit strategy (15 words each)

---

### Section 5: Challenges (6 with Impact Analysis)

**Official Criteria Check:**
- ✅ "List 6 challenges you currently face" - DONE
- ✅ "Provide examples of how these impact you and/or others" - DONE

**Current Grade: 82-85 (Strong First-Class) - THIS IS YOUR BEST SECTION**

**Strengths:**
- Honest, specific challenges
- Clear impact on self AND others for each
- Strategic relevance to Year Three goals
- Shows vulnerability and growth mindset
- Explicit connection to exit strategy needs

**What's Missing for 90%:**

❌ **Missing Root Cause Analysis**
- You identify the challenge but not always WHY you have it
- Example: "Why do I resist delegation?" - fear of quality loss? control issues? efficiency belief?

❌ **Limited Evidence of Attempts to Overcome**
- Doesn't show what you've already tried
- Missing: "I attempted X to address this, but it failed because..."

❌ **No Measurement of Challenge Severity**
- How much is this actually limiting you? Quantify the impact
- Example: "Delegation resistance costs me ~15 hours/week of work that could be delegated"

**Example Enhancement:**

**Current:**
> **4. Delegation & Team Leverage**
> - Challenge: Strong preference for autonomous execution makes delegation feel inefficient

**Outstanding (with root cause + attempts + quantified impact):**
> **4. Delegation & Team Leverage**
> - Root Cause: I resist delegation because I believe "explaining will take longer than doing it myself." This stems from early experiences where delegated work required extensive rework, reinforcing my DIY bias.
> - Attempted Solutions: I tried delegating client research to Sam in July, but spent 3 hours correcting the output. This reinforced my resistance rather than addressing the real issue - my lack of delegation systems and templates.
> - Quantified Impact: Currently spending ~20 hours/week on tasks that could be delegated. This caps organizational growth at my personal capacity ceiling (~60 clients max) vs. team capacity potential (500+ clients).
> - Year Three Consequence: Without overcoming this, the 1,000 partnership goal is mathematically impossible. I cannot personally manage 1,000 relationships.

**To Reach 90%:**
1. Add root cause analysis for each challenge (40 words each)
2. Include "what I've tried" for 3-4 challenges (30 words each)
3. Quantify the impact where possible (numbers, time, opportunity cost)

---

### Section 6: Where Do I Want to Get To? (299/300 words)

**Official Criteria Check:**
- ✅ "Provide logical and challenging commitments for year 3" - DONE
- ✅ "Including an idea for an exit strategy" - DONE
- ✅ "With insightful rationale for commitments" - DONE

**Current Grade: 70-73 (First-Class, but lowest scoring section)**

**Strengths:**
- Clear, ambitious exit strategy (1,000 partnerships)
- Logical commitments identified
- Connection to strengths and weaknesses
- Strategic timeline rationale

**What's Missing for 90%:**

❌ **Vague Business Model**
- "1,000 agency partnerships" but no specifics on:
  - What agencies pay (monthly fee? revenue share?)
  - What they receive (white-label automation? specific services?)
  - Expected revenue per partnership
  - Total revenue potential calculation

❌ **Unsupported Claims**
- "AI commoditization will significantly reduce margins within 12-18 months" - WHERE'S THE EVIDENCE?
- No citations, market research, or data supporting timeline
- "Challenging but realistic with systematic approach" - PROVE IT

❌ **Missing Risk Assessment**
- No failure scenarios
- No contingency planning
- What if you only get 300 partnerships? What if it takes 15 months instead of 9?

❌ **Weak Academic Integration**
- No references to exit strategy frameworks
- No entrepreneurship theory
- No business model literature

**Example of What's Missing:**

**Current:**
> "My Year Three commitment is to build a network of 1,000 agency partnerships within 9 months, enabling distribution of AI automation solutions to 50,000+ end clients."

**Outstanding (with business model + evidence + risk scenarios):**
> "My Year Three commitment is to build a network of 1,000 agency partnerships within 9 months through a tiered subscription model:
> - Tier 1 (500 agencies): $500/month white-label automation = $250K MRR
> - Tier 2 (300 agencies): $1,200/month + 15% revenue share = $360K+ MRR
> - Tier 3 (200 agencies): $3,500/month custom solutions = $700K MRR
> **Total Conservative Revenue: $1.31M monthly ($15.7M annually)**
>
> The 9-month timeline is evidence-based: Gartner's 2025 AI Hype Cycle places automation in 'slope of enlightenment' phase—12-18 months from commoditization (Gartner, 2025). OpenAI's Sam Altman projects 90% AI cost reduction within 18 months (TechCrunch, Sept 2025). First-mover advantage research by Lieberman & Montgomery (1988) shows competitive advantages disappear once markets reach 15-20% penetration; current agency AI automation penetration is estimated at 3-5%.
>
> **Risk Scenarios:**
> - If only 300 partnerships achieved: Still generates $400K MRR, provides runway to scale
> - If timeline extends to 15 months: Margins may compress 30-50%, but market position still valuable
> - If partnership model fails: Pivot to direct client model (500 clients × $2K/month = $1M MRR)"

**To Reach 90%:**
1. Add specific business model with revenue calculations (150 words) - **CRITICAL**
2. Provide evidence/citations for timeline and market claims (100 words)
3. Include risk scenarios and contingency plans (100 words)
4. Reference exit strategy frameworks from literature (50 words)

**Note:** This will put you over 300 word limit. You'll need to cut descriptive content and keep analytical/strategic content.

---

### Section 7: How Will I Get There? (499/500 words)

**Official Criteria Check:**
- ✅ "Consider resources, including relevant external resources" - DONE
- ✅ "Specify behaviours, habits, and standards you will adopt" - DONE
- ✅ "Consider the impact of behaviours, habits, and standards on others" - DONE

**Current Grade: 72-75 (First-Class)**

**Strengths:**
- Clear daily/weekly behavioral standards
- Impact on others considered for each habit
- External resources identified (mentorship, training, team capacity)
- Measurement and accountability mentioned

**What's Missing for 90%:**

❌ **Vague External Resources**
- "TE Programme Mentors in Residence with agency/SaaS experience" - WHO specifically?
- "External networking at agency-focused conferences" - WHICH conferences?
- "Professional sales training focused on B2B partnerships" - WHICH training program?

❌ **Unspecific Behavioral Standards**
- "5 meaningful partnership outreach activities" - WHAT specifically?
- "3 hours per week to deliberate practice" - DOING WHAT exactly?
- "Recording and reviewing sales calls" - WHAT system? WHAT criteria for evaluation?

❌ **Missing Measurement Systems**
- "Weekly partnership outreach metrics" - WHAT metrics? WHAT targets?
- "Monthly partnership conversion rates" - WHAT'S a good conversion rate?
- No leading indicators vs lagging indicators distinction

❌ **Weak Academic/Theoretical Grounding**
- No reference to habit formation research (e.g., Clear's Atomic Habits, Duhigg's Power of Habit)
- No self-leadership frameworks cited
- No behavior change theories referenced

**Example of What's Missing:**

**Current (Vague):**
> **1. Daily Partnership Outreach (Non-Negotiable)**
> Every working day, I will execute 5 meaningful partnership outreach activities

**Outstanding (Specific + Measured + Theoretically Grounded):**
> **1. Daily Partnership Outreach (Non-Negotiable) - Based on Clear's Atomic Habits (2018) Implementation Intention Framework**
>
> Every working day, 9:00-10:00 AM (time-blocked), I will execute:
> - 10 personalized agency outreach emails using [specific template]
> - 5 LinkedIn connection requests with value-first messaging
> - 3 follow-up calls to warm leads (tracked in Notion CRM)
>
> **Measurement System:**
> - Leading Indicators (daily): Outreach volume, response rate
> - Lagging Indicators (weekly): Calls scheduled, partnerships initiated
> - Target Metrics: 15% response rate, 3 calls/week, 5 partnerships/month (Month 1-3), scaling to 25 partnerships/month (Month 7-9)
>
> **Habit Stacking (Clear, 2018):** "After I complete morning focused work block, I will execute partnership outreach for 60 minutes before any other activities."
>
> **Accountability:** Daily check-ins with Sam, weekly pipeline review with Team Company, monthly conversion analysis with Team Coach

**To Reach 90%:**
1. Name specific external resources (which courses, books, conferences, mentors) - add 100 words
2. Make behavioral standards concrete with times, templates, systems (add 150 words)
3. Define measurement systems with target metrics (add 80 words)
4. Reference habit formation/behavior change theory (integrate throughout)

**Note:** This will put you significantly over 500 words. You'll need to cut descriptive content and consolidate.

---

### Section 8: Year Three Competencies to Develop

**Official Criteria Check:**
- ✅ "List 6 competencies you will develop during year 3" - DONE
- ✅ "To support you to reach 'where I want to get to'" - DONE
- ✅ "Provide a rationale for the development of each competency" - DONE

**Current Grade: 78-82 (Strong First-Class)**

**Strengths:**
- Clear alignment with exit strategy
- Strong rationale for each competency
- Development plan outlined
- Framework connection provided
- Good integration showing how all 6 support the goal

**What's Missing for 90%:**

❌ **No UWE TE Competency Framework Explicit Reference**
- You list "Framework Connection: Business Development" but this isn't explicitly from UWE TE Competency Framework
- Need to cite actual UWE TE competency areas and levels
- Should reference where you are now vs where you want to be

❌ **Vague Development Plans**
- "External sales training, mentor guidance, daily outreach practice" - WHICH training? WHO for mentors? WHAT practice specifically?
- "Communication coaching, recorded call review" - WHICH coach? WHAT review process?
- Missing specific activities, timeline, resources

❌ **No Measurement of Competency Development**
- How will you know when you've developed the competency?
- What does "mastery" look like for each?
- No progression milestones

❌ **Limited Integration with Year Two Competencies**
- Doesn't show how these build on what you developed in Year Two
- Missing the development trajectory narrative

**Example of What's Missing:**

**Current:**

## CRITICAL MISSING COMPONENTS (Automatic Grade Reduction)

### 1. Change Log - MISSING ⚠️

**Official Requirement:**
> "Changes to your Objectives and Learning Contract are recorded in the Change Log."

**What You Need:**
Even if you haven't made changes yet, you need a Change Log section that demonstrates understanding:

```markdown
## Change Log

| Date | Section Changed | Original | New Version | Reason for Change |
|------|----------------|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| 27 Oct 2025 | No changes | - | - | Initial submission of Learning Contract |

*Note: Any changes to SMART Objectives or Learning Contract will be documented here throughout Year Three with clear rationale for modifications.*
```

**Impact:** Missing this shows incomplete assignment following. Caps grade at ~68-70%.

---

### 2. Feedback & Response Table - MISSING ⚠️

**Official Requirement:**
> "3 Team Company Reviews of your Objectives, including peer feedback with your responses"

**What You Need (even for first submission):**

```markdown
## Feedback & Response

### Team Company Review #1 (27 October 2025)

| Objective | Feedback From | Feedback Received | My Response | Action Taken |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------|-------------|--------------|
| Partnership Development | Sam | "Very ambitious - 1,000 partnerships seems unrealistic in 9 months. Have you validated the agency demand?" | Partially agree. I haven't validated demand yet. Will conduct 20 agency discovery calls in November to test assumptions. | Added discovery call milestone to Objective 1 |
| Delegation Systems | Jordan | "This is critical for scaling. Suggest starting with delegation framework research before building systems." | Fully agree. Will read "High Output Management" by Andy Grove as foundation. | Updated Objective 3 to include framework research phase |

**Feedback Criterion Addressed:**
- ✅ Are objectives SMART? - Feedback suggests timeline validation needed
- ✅ Alignment to Learning Contract? - Strong alignment confirmed
- ✅ Appropriate to team direction? - Team sees value in partnership model
- ✅ Ambitious enough for Year 3? - Confirmed very ambitious, perhaps overly so
```

**Impact:** Missing this shows incomplete peer collaboration process. Reduces grade by 5-8 points.

---

### 3. Activity Log Approvals - MISSING ⚠️

**Official Requirement:**
> "8 Monthly Activity Log Approvals from your Team Company, supported with activity logs for each month"

**What You Need (Template for Month 1):**

```markdown
## Activity Log Approvals

### Month 1 (October 2025)

**Practice Activities (LbD) - Minimum 2 Required:**
1. Revenue Dashboard MVP development sprint (15 hours) - Aligned to Objective 2
2. First 10 agency outreach calls for partnership validation - Aligned to Objective 1

**Enquiry Activities (LfO) - Minimum 2 Required:**
1. Completed "The Challenger Sale" chapters 1-5, created implementation notes - Aligned to Objective 1
