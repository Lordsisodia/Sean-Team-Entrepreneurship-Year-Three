### Outstanding Performance (90-100%) Requires:

**1. Comprehensive Range of Activities**
- Wide range of valid external enquiry-based learning (not just TE Programme)
- Multiple evidence points per competency (not single activities)
- Balance across self, team, and project/venture competency areas

**2. Strong Exit Strategy Alignment**
- Every undertaking explicitly connected to 1,000 partnership goal
- Clear rationale for why each activity supports the exit strategy
- Measurable progress toward strategic objectives

**3. In-Depth Critical Evaluation**
- Goes beyond description to genuine evaluation and analysis
- Compares different perspectives and approaches
- Identifies limitations and areas for further development
- Shows synthesis across multiple knowledge sources

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid (40-0%)

❌ **Surface-level description without evaluation**
❌ **No connection to exit strategy or Year Three goals**
❌ **Using low-validity sources (random YouTube, blogs)**
❌ **Copying content from sources without synthesis**
❌ **Missing sections or incomplete documentation**
❌ **Generic reflection not specific to your journey**

## EFFICIENT DOCUMENTATION STRATEGY

### As You Work Throughout the Year:

**1. Real-Time Capture (Prevent Last-Minute Panic)**
- After each significant project/activity, spend 15 minutes noting key learning
- Save relevant sources, citations, and references immediately
- Take screenshots/evidence of progress as it happens
- Don't rely on memory months later

**2. Monthly Review Cycle**
- Last week of each month: Review activities and identify potential undertakings
- Document 1-2 undertakings per month rather than batching all at end
- Easier to remember details and emotions when fresh
- Spreads cognitive load across the year

**3. Integration with Activity Log**
- Use Activity Log as source material for undertakings
- Your monthly approvals should reference these learning activities
- Creates natural documentation flow

**4. Team Company Collaboration**
- Share draft undertakings with Team Company for peer feedback
- Use their perspective to strengthen your critical evaluation
- Leverage their observations about your development
