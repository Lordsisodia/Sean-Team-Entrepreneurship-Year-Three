## Overall Grade: 53%

| Criteria | Weight | Mark | Performance Level |
|----------|--------|------|-------------------|
| Engagement in Practice-Based Learning | 40% | Good-Weak (2nd tier) | Lower Second |
| Evaluation of Practice-Based Learning | 60% | Good-Weak (2nd tier) | Lower Second |

## Critical Issue #1: Technical vs Personal Experience 🔴

### The Problem
**Marker Feedback:**
> "They predominantly focus on technical learning related to your ventures, with **little contextual evidence of your actual experience**."

### What This Means
You wrote about WHAT you did (technical tasks, systems built, code written) but not about:
- How it affected YOU personally
- What YOU learned about YOURSELF
- YOUR growth, feelings, challenges
- YOUR behavioural patterns

### Impact
Direct reduction in Evaluation criteria (60% of assignment)

### ✅ Fix for Year 3
**Wrong (Year 2 style):**
> "I developed a 75-step Clojure automation system that processes PDR research in 2 hours instead of 2 weeks."

**Right (Year 3 style):**
> "Building this automation system taught me that I thrive on systematic problem-solving, but I also struggle with perfectionism—I spent 6 weeks refining the system while partnership apps remained incomplete, which delayed our revenue generation."

**Key Difference:** Connect technical work to PERSONAL INSIGHTS about yourself.

---

## Critical Issue #2: Missing Core Activities 🔴

### The Problem
**Marker Feedback:**
> "No engagement in the 3 core activities unfortunately affected your marks"

**Required Core Activities (You Missed ALL):**
1. ❌ Organising Cross-Fertilisation opportunity for others
2. ❌ Working with a social enterprise
3. ❌ Taking part in Customer Week

### Impact
Direct grade reduction in Engagement criteria (40% of assignment)

### ✅ Fix for Year 3
- **Complete ALL required core activities**
- **Track requirements early in the year**
- **Don't skip mandatory components**
- **Document participation evidence**

---

## Critical Issue #3: Incomplete Documentation 🔴

### The Problem
**Marker Feedback:**
> "Most of the Project Review and venture links don't work, or templates are blank. There are a few Pre-Project reviews completed in Sept 2024, but **evidence of progression is limited**."

### What Was Missing
- ❌ Pre-Project Reviews (mostly blank/incomplete)
- ❌ Interim-Project Reviews (missing)
- ❌ Post-Project Reviews (missing)
- ❌ Working links (broken)
- ❌ Template completion (blank)

### Impact
Markers cannot see your progression; shows incomplete engagement

### ✅ Fix for Year 3
- **Complete ALL required templates and reviews**
- **Ensure all links work**
- **Don't leave blanks**
- **Show progression over time** (Sept → Jan → Apr)
- **Document Pre/Interim/Post for ALL projects**

---

## Critical Issue #4: Generic vs Team-Specific Examples 🟡

### The Problem
**Marker Feedback:**
> "Each of these could also be related to your experiences with Team Apollo, to strengthen the evidence in being more specific and directly related to your experience on the programme too."

### What This Means
Your competencies and undertakings feel GENERIC. They need to be grounded in SPECIFIC Team Apollo experiences.

### Impact
Evidence feels hypothetical, not real; reduced credibility

### ✅ Fix for Year 3
**Wrong (Generic):**
> "I developed communication skills through various interactions."

**Right (Team Apollo Specific):**
> "When working with Sam on the agency partnership model, I struggled to explain the technical concepts clearly, which resulted in a 25% closing rate. This taught me that I need to simplify my communication and use more visual examples."

**Key Pattern:** Always reference specific team members, projects, and situations.

---

## What You Did Well (Strengths to Maintain) ✅

### Strength 1: Self-Directed Learning
> "You engaged in Practice-based activities of your own initiative."

**Keep this:** Show initiative and drive in Year 3.

### Strength 2: Clear Specialisation Alignment
> "All [activities] explicitly linked with your specialisation path."

**Keep this:** Maintain clear connection to your exit strategy.

### Strength 3: Balanced Competency Coverage
> "The learning activities address the 3 competency areas of self, team and projects/ventures across the academic year."

**Keep this:** Cover all three areas (self, team, projects).

### Strength 4: Some Self-Awareness
> "There is evidence of an adequate level of self-awareness and some progression in your top 6 competencies."

**Build on this:** Deepen the self-awareness; be more honest about failures.

## Writing Pattern Analysis

### Your Year 2 Tendencies (What You Did)

| Aspect | Tendency | Result |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Content Focus | Technical tasks | ❌ Poor marks |
| Personal Experience | Minimal | ❌ Poor marks |
| Examples | Generic | ⚠️ Weak evidence |
| Team References | Absent | ⚠️ Weak credibility |
| Documentation | Incomplete | ❌ Poor marks |
| Self-Awareness | Adequate | ⚠️ Room to grow |

### What You Must Change for Year 3

| Aspect | Year 2 Style | Year 3 Requirement |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| Content Focus | Technical tasks | **Personal experience/growth** |
| Perspective | Objective description | **Subjective "I" perspective** |
| Examples | Generic statements | **Specific Team Apollo situations** |
| Documentation | Incomplete | **100% complete** |
| Self-Awareness | Adequate | **High (honest about failures)** |

## Quick Reference Checklist

For EVERY section you write in Year 3, ask yourself:

### Content Check:
- [ ] Did I include "I" statements?
- [ ] Did I write about MY experience, not just what I did?
- [ ] Did I connect activities to personal growth/learning?
- [ ] Did I include specific Team Apollo examples?
- [ ] Did I name specific team members/situations?

### Personal Experience Check:
- [ ] "This taught me that I..."
- [ ] "I noticed a pattern where I..."
- [ ] "I struggled with..."
- [ ] "I realized that I..."
- [ ] "This situation revealed..."

### Avoid:
- [ ] No technical descriptions without personal insights
- [ ] No generic examples ("I developed communication skills")
- [ ] No hypothetical situations
- [ ] No blank templates or incomplete documentation

## The #1 Rule for Year 3

**Markers don't care about WHAT you built.**

**They care about:**
1. How it changed YOU
2. What YOU learned about YOURSELF
3. How it affected YOUR behaviour
4. What patterns YOU noticed in yourself
5. How YOU grew (or failed)

**Every technical statement must be followed by a personal insight.**

---

## Example Conversion

### Q1: Where Have I Been?

**Don't Write (Year 2 Style):**
> "In Year 2, I built a 75-step automation system using Clojure. I also worked on a Nigerian crypto client project where I recommended API integration instead of hard-coding, saving them $100,000."

**Do Write (Year 3 Style):**
> "Building the 75-step automation system revealed a critical pattern in my behaviour: I become so absorbed in technical perfection that I lose sight of strategic priorities. The 6-week delay on our internal app—while I refined automation processes—taught me that my drive for excellence can become counterproductive when it prevents us from serving clients. Similarly, the crypto client situation showed me that I can confidently provide technical leadership, but I struggle when clients don't accept my recommendations, indicating a need to develop my persuasion skills."

**Notice:**
- Technical achievement mentioned briefly
- **Personal insights emphasized**
- Specific failures highlighted
- Patterns identified
- Self-awareness demonstrated

---

## Remember This

**Your Year 2 grade of 53% was NOT because:**
- You didn't do impressive work
- You weren't capable
- Your technical skills weren't strong

**It WAS because:**
- You wrote about technical work instead of personal experience
- You didn't complete required documentation
- You missed core activities
- Your examples were generic instead of specific

**All of these are fixable.** Your technical achievements are impressive—now we just need to frame them through the lens of personal growth and self-awareness.
