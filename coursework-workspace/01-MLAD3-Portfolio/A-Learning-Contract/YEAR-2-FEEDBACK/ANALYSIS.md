**Module:** Enquiry into Enterprise and Entrepreneurship 2 (Portfolio of Practice)

---

## Grade Breakdown

| Criteria | Weight | Mark | Level |
|----------|--------|------|--------|
| Engagement in Practice-Based Learning | 40% | Good-Weak (2nd tier) | Lower Second |
| Evaluation of Practice-Based Learning | 60% | Good-Weak (2nd tier) | Lower Second |
| **Overall** | **100%** | **53%** | **Lower Second** |

## Key Issues Identified

### Issue 1: No Core Activity Engagement 🔴 CRITICAL

**What Markers Said:**
> "No engagement in the 3 core activities unfortunately affected your marks (Organising Cross-Fertilisation opportunity for others, working with a social enterprise, taking part in Customer Week.)"

**Translation:** You missed required activities completely. This is a compliance issue, not quality.

**Impact:** Direct grade reduction in Engagement criteria

**Lesson for Year 3:**
- ✅ Complete ALL required core activities
- ✅ Don't skip mandatory components
- ✅ Track requirements early in the year

---

### Issue 2: Evaluation Focuses Too Much on Technical Learning 🔴 CRITICAL

**What Markers Said:**
> "They predominantly focus on technical learning related to your ventures, with little contextual evidence of your actual experience."

**Translation:** You wrote about WHAT you did (technical stuff) but not HOW it affected YOU personally (your experience, growth, feelings).

**Impact:** Reduced marks in Evaluation criteria (60% of assignment)

**Lesson for Year 3:**
- ❌ DON'T just describe technical tasks and projects
- ✅ DO focus on YOUR personal learning, growth, and experience
- ✅ Connect technical work to personal development
- ✅ Include YOUR perspective, not just objective description

**Example:**
- ❌ "I developed a Clojure automation system that processes 75 steps..."
- ✅ "Developing this automation system taught me that I thrive on systematic problem-solving, but I also struggled with delegating the technical implementation, which delayed our internal app by 6 weeks..."

---

### Issue 3: Missing or Incomplete Project Reviews 🔴 CRITICAL

**What Markers Said:**
> "Most of the Project Review and venture links don't work, or templates are blank. There are a few Pre-Project reviews completed in Sept 2024, but evidence of progression is limited."

**Translation:** You didn't complete required documentation (Pre/Interim/Post reviews). Links broken, templates blank.

**Impact:** Shows incomplete engagement; markers can't see your progression

**Lesson for Year 3:**
- ✅ Complete ALL required templates and reviews
- ✅ Ensure links work
- ✅ Don't leave blanks
- ✅ Show progression over time (Sept → Jan → Apr)

---

### Issue 4: Limited Connection to Team Experience 🟡 IMPORTANT

**What Markers Said:**
> "Each of these could also be related to your experiences with Team Apollo, to strengthen the evidence in being more specific and directly related to your experience on the programme too."

**Translation:** Your competencies/undertakings aren't clearly connected to your actual team work. Make them more specific to Team Apollo.

**Impact:** Evidence feels generic, not grounded in actual experience

**Lesson for Year 3:**
- ✅ Explicitly connect competencies to Team Apollo experiences
- ✅ Use specific team examples: "When working with Sam on X, I..."
- ✅ Reference actual team situations, not hypothetical

---

## What You Did Well (Strengths to Build On)

### Strength 1: Self-Directed Learning
> "You engaged in Practice-based activities of your own initiative."

**Keep doing this in Year 3.**

### Strength 2: Clear Specialisation Path
> "All explicitly linked with your specialisation path."

**Keep this alignment in Year 3.**

### Strength 3: Three Competency Areas Covered
> "The learning activities address the 3 competency areas of self, team and projects/ventures across the academic year."

**Maintain this balance in Year 3.**

### Strength 4: Some Self-Awareness
> "There is evidence of an adequate level of self-awareness and some progression in your top 6 competencies."

**Build on this foundation - deepen the self-awareness.**

---

## Pattern Analysis: Your Writing Tendencies

### What Tends to Work (Keep Doing):
- Clear connection to your specialization path
- Covering all 3 competency areas
- Self-directed activity engagement
- Some evidence of self-awareness

### What Doesn't Work (Must Change):
- **Technical description over personal experience** - This is the biggest issue
- **Incomplete documentation** - Blank templates, broken links
- **Missing core activities** - Compliance failures
- **Generic rather than specific examples** - Needs more Team Apollo grounding

---

## Implications for Year 3 Learning Contract

### Critical Changes Needed:

**1. Shift from Technical → Personal**
Your Year 2 feedback was clear: you wrote too much about technical work and not enough about YOUR experience.

**For Year 3 Q1 (Where Have I Been):**
- ❌ Don't: "I built X, I developed Y, I implemented Z..."
- ✅ Do: "Building X taught me that I [personal insight about myself]. When I struggled with Y, I realized [personal pattern]..."

**For Year 3 Q2 (Where Am I Now):**
- ❌ Don't: "My INTJ profile means I'm good at strategy..."
- ✅ Do: "My INTJ preference for strategic thinking manifests when I [specific Team Apollo situation]. This caused [outcome] and taught me [personal lesson]..."

**For Year 3 Q4 (How Will I Get There):**
- ❌ Don't: "I will develop Service Design by building a partnership framework..."
- ✅ Do: "I need to develop Service Design because in Team Apollo, I struggled with [specific example]. This competency matters for my exit strategy because [personal reason]..."

---

### 2. Ground Everything in Actual Experience

**Year 3 Rule:** Every claim must be backed by a specific example from:
- Team Apollo work
- Your ventures
- Specific situations with dates/names

**For each assertion, ask:**
- "What specific situation proves this?"
- "When did this happen? Who was involved?"
- "What was the outcome?"

---

### 3. Complete All Documentation

**Year 3 Must-Haves:**
- ✅ Complete ALL required reviews (Pre/Interim/Post)
- ✅ Ensure all links work
- ✅ No blank templates
- ✅ Show progression over time

---

## Grade Trajectory

```
Year 2: 53% (Lower Second)
         ↓
         ❌ Technical focus, incomplete docs
         ❌ Missing core activities
         ✅ Good specialisation alignment
         ✅ Self-directed learning

Year 3: ???
         ↓
         🎯 Target: 90-100% (Outstanding)
         ✅ More personal (less technical)
         ✅ Complete all documentation
         ✅ Ground in Team Apollo experience
         ✅ Deepen self-awareness
```

## Quick Reference: Year 2 → Year 3 Conversion

| Aspect | Year 2 (53%) | Year 3 Target (90%+) |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|
| Focus | Technical tasks | Personal experience/growth |
| Evidence | Generic | Specific (Team Apollo examples) |
| Documentation | Incomplete (blank templates) | Complete (all reviews done) |
| Self-awareness | Adequate | High (honest about failures) |
| Core activities | Missed some | All completed |
| Connection to programme | Limited | Strong (Team Apollo integration) |

---

## Updated Harsh Assessment Criteria

Given your Year 2 feedback, I now know to look specifically for:

**RED FLAGS (must avoid):**
- Content that sounds like technical documentation
- Lack of "I" statements and personal experience
- Generic examples not tied to Team Apollo
- Missing documentation or incomplete templates

**GREEN FLAGS (must include):**
- Personal experience: "This taught me that I..."
- Team Apollo examples: "When working with [teammate] on [project]..."
- Self-awareness: "I noticed a pattern where I..."
- Honest failures: "I struggled with X because..."
- Specific situations with dates/outcomes
