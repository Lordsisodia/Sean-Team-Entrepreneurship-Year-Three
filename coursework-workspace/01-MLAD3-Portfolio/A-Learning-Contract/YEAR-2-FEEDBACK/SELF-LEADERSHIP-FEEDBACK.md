## Critical Issue #1: Missing Components 🟡

### The Problem
**Marker Feedback:**
> "Most components have been completed... However, there may be areas missing such as **Approval**, **Team Company Review** and **feedback/response** and **limited reflection in the Learning Contract**."

### What Was Missing
- ❌ Some Activity Logs not approved (only 6 of 8)
- ❌ Team Company Review incomplete (only 2 of 3 reviews)
- ❌ Limited reflection in Learning Contract

### Impact
Components missing = "Most components completed" not "All components"

### ✅ Fix for Year 3
- **Get ALL 8 Activity Log approvals** (not 6 of 8)
- **Complete ALL 3 Team Company Reviews** with proper documentation
- **Deepen Learning Contract reflection**
- **Ensure ALL feedback/response documented**

---

## Critical Issue #2: Imbalanced Objectives 🟡

### The Problem
**Marker Feedback:**
> "There is a **strong focus on your venture** which is commendable. However, next year ensure you **balance this more with specific self and team objectives**."

### What This Means
Your 6 SMART objectives were heavily venture-focused. You need:
- More **self-development** objectives
- More **team-development** objectives
- Fewer **venture** objectives

### Impact
Shows narrow focus; not balanced across self/team/projects

### ✅ Fix for Year 3
**Required Balance (2-2-2):**
- **2 Self-development objectives** (habits, mindset, behaviours)
- **2 Team-development objectives** (team targets, communication)
- **2 Venture objectives** (pitching, financial, project management)

---

## Critical Issue #3: Weak Team Company Reviews 🟡

### The Problem
**Marker Feedback:**
> "The 3 reviews showed **little critical evaluation** of the process, **building on learnings from previous reviews**. They also **weren't fully aligned to requirements** (i.e. feedback criteria in review 2)."

### What This Means
- Reviews lacked depth and critical evaluation
- Didn't show progression from review to review
- Review 2 didn't follow the required feedback criteria format

### Impact
Team Company Review process is a key component; weak execution here limits marks

### ✅ Fix for Year 3
- **Deepen critical evaluation in each review**
- **Show progression:** Review 2 should reference Review 1 insights
- **Build on learnings:** Show how feedback changed your approach
- **Follow the exact feedback criteria format**
- **Get 2+ team members to review each time**

---

## Critical Issue #4: Final Analysis Needs More Depth 🟡

### The Problem
**Marker Feedback:**
> "More **critical evaluation** of your own development would have added more depth to illustrate your learning."

### What This Means
Your Final Analysis (Q5) was good but could have been better with:
- More critical self-evaluation
- Deeper analysis of your development
- More honest assessment of strengths/weaknesses

### Impact
Final Analysis is worth 40% of the assignment; depth matters

### ✅ Fix for Year 3
- **Be more critical of yourself** (honest about failures)
- **Evaluate your development more deeply**
- **Don't shy away from difficult truths**
- **Show self-awareness through honest assessment**

---

## What You Did Well (Strengths)

### Strength 1: Learning Contract
> "Your learning contract clearly outlines your intentions for the year, informed by previous learnings."

**Keep this:** Clear, informed intentions.

### Strength 2: SMART Objectives
> "Clear objectives and progress overall with progress ratings supported by clear rationale and evidence."

**Keep this:** Clear objectives with evidence.

### Strength 3: Change Log
> "The change log illustrates regular engagement with updates to objectives throughout the year."

**Keep this:** Regular engagement and updates.

### Strength 4: Undertakings
> "You had completed 3 of each undertaking by end Jan."

**Keep this:** On-track completion; finish all 6 of each by deadline.

### Strength 5: Feedback Response
> "The feedback table shows improvements informed by feedback during the year."

**Keep this:** Actually using feedback to improve.

---

## The Pattern: Self-Leadership vs Enquiry

### What This Reveals About You

**Strengths (when focused on self):**
- You're better at reflecting on YOUR experience
- You can outline clear intentions
- You provide rationale and evidence for objectives
- You respond to feedback and make changes

**Weaknesses (when focused on external enquiry):**
- You struggle to evaluate external sources critically
- You focus too narrowly on one topic (AI)
- You don't compare/contrast different perspectives
- Your source validity is weaker

**Insight:**
You're naturally better at **self-reflection** than at **external enquiry**.

For Year 3, this means:
- ✅ Play to your strength: MORE self-reflection and personal experience
- ⚠️ Work on weakness: Better source evaluation, more critical thinking

---

## Combined Year 3 Action Plan

Based on all three Year 2 modules, here's what must change:

### 1. Fix the Balance (2-2-2 Rule)

**Your Year 2 Pattern:**
- Too many venture objectives
- Not enough self/team objectives

**Year 3 Requirement:**
- 2 Self-development (habits, mindset, time management, accountability)
- 2 Team-development (team targets, communication, collaboration)
- 2 Venture (pitching, negotiation, financial management)

---

### 2. Complete Everything

**What was missing in Year 2:**
- Activity Log: Only 6 of 8 approved
- Team Company Review: Only 2 of 3 done
- Learning Contract: Limited reflection

**Year 3 Requirement:**
- ✅ ALL 8 Activity Log approvals
- ✅ ALL 3 Team Company Reviews
- ✅ Full Learning Contract reflection
- ✅ ALL feedback/response documented

---

### 3. Deepen Critical Evaluation

**Year 2 Final Analysis was "good" but needed "more depth"**

**For Year 3 Q5 (Where Did I Get To?):**
- More critical of yourself (be honest about failures)
- Deeper evaluation of development
- Stronger connection between plans and reality
- More significant future plans

**Key:** "Good" isn't enough for 90-100%. Need "in-depth critical evaluation."

---

### 4. Show Progression

**Year 2 Issue:** Reviews didn't build on each other

**Year 3 Fix:**
- Review 2 should reference: "In Review 1, I identified X. Since then, I..."
- Review 3 should reference: "Based on Reviews 1 and 2, I've learned that..."
- Show clear evolution of thinking

---

## Grade Progression: What This Tells Us

```
Year 2 Module Performance:
Portfolio of Enquiry:    40% (Third Class)   ← Weakest: External learning
Portfolio of Practice:    53% (Lower Second)    ← Weak: Technical focus
Portfolio of Self-Leadership: 62% (Upper Second) ← Strongest: Self-reflection

Insight: You're best at reflecting on yourself.
Year 3 Strategy: DOUBLE DOWN on personal experience/reflection.
```

## The 3-Tier Feedback Structure

Your Year 2 feedback shows a clear pattern in how markers assess your work:

### Tier 1: Enquiry (40%) - Weakest
**Focus:** Learning from external sources
**Your Issue:** All external, no internal; narrow focus; weak evaluation
**Fix:** Balance internal/external; diversify topics; deeper critical evaluation

### Tier 2: Practice (53%) - Weak
**Focus:** Learning from doing (venture work)
**Your Issue:** Technical focus, not personal; incomplete docs
**Fix:** Personal experience over technical description; complete everything

### Tier 3: Self-Leadership (62%) - Strongest
**Focus:** Self-reflection and personal development
**Your Strength:** Clear intentions; good objectives; regular engagement
**Build On:** This is your natural strength

---

## Year 3 Strategy: Play to Your Strength

**Since Self-Leadership was your best module (62%), do more of that:**

1. **More self-reflection** in every section
2. **More "I" statements** about personal experience
3. **More honest assessment** of strengths and weaknesses
4. **More critical evaluation** of your own development

**Since Enquiry was your worst module (40%), be careful with:**

1. **Don't make everything about AI** (diversify topics)
2. **Compare and contrast sources** (show relationships)
3. **Evaluate source validity** (use rigorous sources)
4. **Balance internal/external learning** (use TE resources)

---

## Quick Reference: The 62% Formula

**What got you 62% in Self-Leadership:**
- ✅ Clear intentions informed by previous learnings
- ✅ Clear objectives with rationale and evidence
- ✅ Regular engagement (change log updated)
- ✅ Strong focus on venture (but need balance)
- ✅ Improvements informed by feedback

**What would get you 90%+:**
- All above, PLUS:
- ✅ Balanced objectives (not just venture)
- ✅ ALL components complete (8/8 approvals, 3/3 reviews)
- ✅ Deeper critical evaluation (especially in Q5)
- ✅ More honest self-assessment
- ✅ Stronger progression shown across reviews

---

## Combined Year 2 Issues: All 15 Problems

### From Self-Leadership (62%):
13. Missing components (approvals, reviews)
14. Imbalanced objectives (too much venture)
15. Weak Team Company Reviews (little critical evaluation)
16. Final Analysis needs more depth

### From Practice (53%):
1-4 (Technical focus, incomplete docs, etc.)

### From Enquiry (40%):
5-12 (All external, misclassification, etc.)

**All documented in YEAR-2-SUMMARY.md**
