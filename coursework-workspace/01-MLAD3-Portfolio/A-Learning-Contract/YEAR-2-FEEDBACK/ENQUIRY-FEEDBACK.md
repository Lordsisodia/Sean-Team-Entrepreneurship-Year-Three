## Critical Issue #1: All External, No Internal Learning 🔴

### The Problem
**Marker Feedback:**
> "All of your activities have been **external**. While this is good in terms of engaging in relevant learning of your own initiative, it would have been valuable to have engaged in **more internal activities also**, such as the TE programme workshops, Mentors in Residence, etc."

### What This Means
You did your own learning outside of TE but missed the internal opportunities provided by the programme:
- ❌ TE programme workshops
- ❌ Mentors in Residence
- ❌ Other internal TE resources

### Impact
Shows lack of engagement with programme-provided learning opportunities

### ✅ Fix for Year 3
- **Balance internal and external learning**
- **Attend TE workshops and document the learning**
- **Engage with Mentors in Residence**
- **Don't just rely on self-directed external learning**

---

## Critical Issue #2: Wrong Undertaking Types 🔴

### The Problem
**Marker Feedback:**
> "Two Undertakings are **LbD rather than LfO** (AI agent network expansion, AI Innovators Hub)."

### What This Means
You misclassified Learning by Doing activities as Learning from Others.

- **LfO (Learning from Others):** Reading, networking, courses, workshops, mentorship
- **LbD (Learning by Doing):** Hands-on work, building, venture activities

You counted venture work as "Learning from Others" - this is incorrect.

### Impact
Shows lack of understanding of the undertaking types

### ✅ Fix for Year 3
- **LfO = External sources** (books, courses, events, mentors)
- **LbD = Your own venture work**
- **Don't misclassify**
- **If it's your venture, it's LbD**
- **If you're learning FROM others, it's LfO**

---

## Critical Issue #3: Broken Links 🔴

### The Problem
**Marker Feedback:**
> "None of the links to feedback are accessible either in the AI agent document."

### What This Means
You referenced links to feedback/documentation, but they didn't work.

### Impact
Markers cannot verify your claims; reduces credibility

### ✅ Fix for Year 3
- **Test all links before submitting**
- **Ensure feedback documents are accessible**
- **Don't reference external resources that can't be accessed**

---

## Critical Issue #4: Generic Evaluation 🟡

### The Problem
**Marker Feedback:**
> "Your evaluation... tends to be **too generic**."

### What This Means
Your evaluation of learning lacks specificity and depth.

### ✅ Fix for Year 3
- **Be specific about what you learned**
- **Name specific concepts, ideas, insights**
- **Connect learning to specific situations**

---

## Critical Issue #5: All Focus on AI Venture 🔴

### The Problem
**Marker Feedback:**
> "All the LfO evidence is **very focused on your AI venture elements**, and lack thorough and meaningful evaluation of professional values, ethics, practices and behaviours."

### What This Means
You only wrote about AI-related learning. You didn't evaluate:
- Professional values
- Ethics
- Practices
- Behaviours

### Impact
Missing a key component of enquiry evaluation

### ✅ Fix for Year 3
- **Diversify learning topics beyond just AI**
- **Include evaluation of values/ethics/practices/behaviours**
- **Connect learning to professional development, not just venture**

---

## Critical Issue #6: Source Validity Weak 🟡

### The Problem
**Marker Feedback:**
> "The validity of sources could also be **more rigorous**."

### What This Means
Your sources may not be credible enough. For top marks, you need:
- Academic journals
- Books from reputable publishers
- Industry thought leaders
- **NOT:** random websites, blogs, unknown sources

### ✅ Fix for Year 3
- **Use academic sources where possible**
- **Prioritize peer-reviewed journals**
- **Use established thought leaders**
- **Evaluate source credibility explicitly**
- **Avoid low-quality online sources**

---

## Critical Issue #7: Compare/Contrast Missing 🟡

### The Problem
**Marker Feedback:**
> "The ability to **compare and contrast different perspectives** could be highlighted more."

### What This Means
You listed sources but didn't show how they relate to each other.

### ✅ Fix for Year 3
- **Don't just list sources**
- **Show relationships: "Source A says X, while Source B says Y..."**
- **Synthesize: "Combining these perspectives, I conclude that..."**
- **Compare: "These sources agree on X but disagree on Y..."**

---

## Critical Issue #8: Missed Content Opportunities 🟡

### The Problem
**Marker Feedback:**
> "In the competency undertakings, you mention a variety of concepts and sources (books, courses, workshops) - it would have been **beneficial to expand on these** in your LfO undertakings."

### What This Means
You mentioned learning resources in competency undertakings but didn't write full LfO undertakings about them.

### Impact
Missed opportunities to show more learning depth

### ✅ Fix for Year 3
- **If you read a book/course/workshop, write a full LfO undertaking**
- **Don't just mention it in passing**
- **Extract full value from all learning activities**

---

## What You Did Well (Strengths)

### Strength 1: Initiative
> "Engaged in relevant learning of your own initiative."

**Keep this:** Self-directed learning is valuable.

### Strength 2: Alignment
> "Aligned to your venture learning."

**Keep this:** Connect learning to your specialisation.

### Strength 3: Some Specific Examples
> "Daily Updates, Mentoring with Pranav, and the Case Study Analysis provide more specific learning."

**Build on this:** Make ALL examples this specific.

## The 8 Critical Issues from Year 2

### From Practice Portfolio:
1. **Technical vs Personal** - Wrote about tasks, not experience
2. **Missing Core Activities** - Didn't do required things
3. **Incomplete Documentation** - Blank templates, broken links
4. **Generic Examples** - Not tied to Team Apollo

### From Enquiry Portfolio:
5. **All External, No Internal** - Didn't use TE resources
6. **Wrong Undertaking Types** - Misclassified LbD as LfO
7. **All AI Focus** - Too narrow, lacked values/ethics
8. **Weak Source Validity** - Sources not rigorous enough

---

## The Pattern: What's Holding You Back

### Writing Issues:
- **Technical description** instead of personal experience
- **Generic examples** instead of specific situations
- **Venture-focused** instead of balanced learning

### Process Issues:
- **Incomplete documentation** (blank templates)
- **Broken links** (can't verify claims)
- **Misclassified content** (wrong undertaking types)

### Engagement Issues:
- **Missing core activities**
- **All external learning** (no internal TE resources)
- **Too narrow focus** (only AI, no broader learning)

---

## Year 3 Requirements: What Must Change

### Content Changes:

1. **Personal > Technical**
   - Write about YOUR experience, not just what you built
   - Connect everything to personal growth/learning

2. **Specific > Generic**
   - Use Team Apollo examples with names/dates
   - Reference specific situations, not general statements

3. **Balanced > Narrow**
   - Learn beyond just AI
   - Cover values, ethics, practices, behaviours
   - Include internal TE resources

### Process Changes:

4. **Complete > Incomplete**
   - Fill ALL templates
   - Fix ALL links
   - Do ALL required activities

5. **Correct Classification**
   - LfO = Learning FROM others (books, courses, mentors)
   - LbD = Your own venture work
   - Don't mix them up

6. **Rigorous Sources**
   - Use academic journals, reputable books
   - Evaluate source credibility
   - Avoid low-quality online content
