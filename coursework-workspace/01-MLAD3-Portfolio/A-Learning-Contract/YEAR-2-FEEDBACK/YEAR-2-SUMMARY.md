# Year 2 Feedback: Complete Summary & Action Plan

**Date:** January 20, 2026
**Purpose:** Complete analysis of both Year 2 portfolios to guide Year 3 improvements

---

## Overall Performance

| Module | Grade | Classification | Key Issue |
|--------|-------|--------------|------------|
| Portfolio of Practice | 53% | Lower Second | Technical focus, not personal |
| Portfolio of Enquiry | 40% | **Third Class** | All external, no internal learning |
| Portfolio of Self-Leadership | 62% | Upper Second | Your strongest module |
| **Combined Average** | **~52%** | **Lower Second** | Fixable issues |

## Key Insight: Your Performance Pattern

**You're best at self-reflection, weakest at external enquiry.**

| Module | Grade | Focus |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Enquiry (40%) | Poorest | External sources, critical evaluation |
| Practice (53%) | Weak | Technical work, personal experience |
| Self-Leadership (62%) | Strongest | Self-reflection, personal development |

**Year 3 Strategy: Double down on self-reflection (your strength) while improving enquiry skills.**

## The 12 Critical Issues (All Must Be Fixed)

### Content Issues (How You Write)

**1. Technical vs Personal Experience** 🔴 MOST CRITICAL
- **Problem:** Wrote about technical tasks, not personal experience
- **Fix:** Connect everything to "I" statements about growth/learning
- **Pattern:** "I built X system..." → "Building X taught me that I..."

**2. Generic vs Specific Examples** 🔴
- **Problem:** Examples not tied to Team Apollo or specific situations
- **Fix:** Use names, dates, specific team situations
- **Pattern:** "I developed communication..." → "When working with Sam on X project..."

**3. All AI Focus** 🔴
- **Problem:** Learning only about AI, nothing broader
- **Fix:** Diversify topics; include values, ethics, practices, behaviours
- **Pattern:** Don't make everything about AI/automation

**4. Missing Values/Ethics Evaluation** 🔴
- **Problem:** Didn't evaluate professional values, ethics, practices, behaviours
- **Fix:** Include reflection on these in all undertakings

**5. Generic Evaluation** 🟡
- **Problem:** Evaluation too general, lacking specificity
- **Fix:** Be specific about what you learned and how it applies

**6. No Compare/Contrast** 🟡
- **Problem:** Listed sources but didn't show relationships
- **Fix:** Show how sources agree/disagree; synthesize perspectives

### Process Issues (What You Did)

**7. Incomplete Documentation** 🔴
- **Problem:** Blank templates, broken links, missing reviews
- **Fix:** Complete ALL templates; test ALL links; do ALL reviews

**8. Missing Core Activities** 🔴
- **Problem:** Didn't do required activities (Cross-fertilisation, Social Enterprise, Customer Week)
- **Fix:** Complete ALL required core activities in Year 3

**9. Wrong Undertaking Classification** 🔴
- **Problem:** Listed LbD activities as LfO
- **Fix:**
  - LfO = Learning FROM others (books, courses, workshops, mentors)
  - LbD = Your own venture work
  - Don't mix them up

**10. Broken Links** 🔴
- **Problem:** Referenced feedback links that don't work
- **Fix:** Test all links; ensure accessibility

**11. All External, No Internal Learning** 🔴
- **Problem:** Only did self-directed learning, didn't use TE resources
- **Fix:** Balance external learning with internal (workshops, mentors, etc.)

**12. Weak Source Validity** 🟡
- **Problem:** Sources not rigorous enough
- **Fix:** Use academic journals, reputable books, established thought leaders

## The #1 Insight

**Your Year 2 performance wasn't about capability—it was about framing.**

You did impressive work (75 AI agents, automation systems, crypto client savings). But you wrote about:
- ❌ WHAT you built (technical achievements)
- ❌ HOW you did it (technical processes)
- ❌ Generic descriptions

Instead of:
- ✅ How it changed YOU
- ✅ What YOU learned about YOURSELF
- ✅ YOUR behavioural patterns
- ✅ YOUR growth and struggles

**Markers don't grade your technical achievements. They grade your self-awareness and personal learning.**

---

## Year 3 Action Plan: What Must Change

### Writing Rule: The Personal Experience Test

Before submitting ANY content, ask:

**"Is this sentence about ME and MY experience?"**

If the sentence is about:
- A technical system you built → Rewrite to focus on what you learned
- A project you completed → Rewrite to focus on how it changed you
- A skill you developed → Rewrite to focus on the personal journey

**Every paragraph should have multiple "I" statements:**
- "I learned that..."
- "I noticed that..."
- "I struggled with..."
- "I realized that..."
- "This pattern shows that I..."

---

### Documentation Rule: Complete Everything

**Before submission, verify:**
- [ ] ALL templates filled (no blanks)
- [ ] ALL links tested (all work)
- [ ] ALL reviews complete (Pre/Interim/Post)
- [ ] ALL undertakings properly classified
- [ ] ALL core activities documented

---

### Learning Rule: Balance Internal + External

**Target balance:**
- 50% External learning (books, courses, your own research)
- 50% Internal learning (TE workshops, Mentors in Residence, team activities)

**Diversify topics:**
- Not just AI/automation
- Include: leadership, teamwork, ethics, values, communication, etc.

---

### Evidence Rule: Specific or Nothing

**Every claim must be backed by:**
- Specific team member names (Sam, Team Apollo)
- Specific projects (agency model, crypto client)
- Specific dates/timeframes
- Specific outcomes (numbers, results)

**If you can't name a specific example, don't make the claim.**

## Quick Conversion Examples

### Undertakings

**Wrong (Year 2 Style):**
> "I read 'The Lean Startup' which taught me about MVP development and iterative testing. This was valuable for my venture."

**Right (Year 3 Style):**
> "Reading 'The Lean Startup' challenged my perfectionist tendencies. When Ries described 'validated learning,' I realized I had spent 6 weeks perfecting our internal automation system without any customer validation—exactly the anti-pattern he warns against. This insight led me to launch a rapid MVP of our partnership offering, which resulted in 4 agency conversations in 2 weeks, though my closing rate was only 25% because I still struggle with the direct sales conversation."

**Notice:**
- Book mentioned briefly
- **Personal insight emphasized**
- Specific failure (6-week delay)
- Specific outcome (4 conversations, 25% rate)
- Self-awareness about struggle

### Competencies

**Wrong (Year 2 Style):**
> "Service Design & Delivery: I developed a partnership framework and onboarded 4 agencies. Current level: 7/10. Target: 9/10."

**Right (Year 3 Style):**
> "Service Design & Delivery: My work on the agency partnership framework revealed both a strength and a weakness. I excel at creating systematic processes—the framework itself was comprehensive and clear. However, I struggle with the final step of conversion. In 4 agency conversations, I successfully explained the model but couldn't close the deal, showing a 75% drop-off between interest and commitment. This pattern (excellent systems, weak execution) appears across my work. Current level: 6/10. Target: 9/10 by April through focused practice on direct sales conversations and mentorship from Pranav, who excels at relationship closing."

**Notice:**
- Specific example (4 conversations, 75% drop-off)
- Pattern identified across work
- Honest current level (not inflated)
- Specific target with plan
- Named mentor (Pranav)

- [ ] Values/ethics/practices/behaviours reflected on?

### Documentation:
- [ ] All blanks filled?
- [ ] All links working?
- [ ] All reviews complete?
- [ ] Correct classifications (LfO vs LbD)?

### Learning:
- [ ] Internal TE resources included?
- [ ] Topics diversified (not just AI)?
- [ ] Sources credible (journals, books)?
- [ ] Different perspectives compared/contrasted?

### Evidence:
- [ ] Specific examples (names, dates, numbers)?
- [ ] Team Apollo situations referenced?

## Remember

**Your technical achievements are impressive.** The 75 AI agents, automation systems, crypto client work—all of it is excellent content.

**The issue is how you frame it.**

- Year 2: "Look what I built" → 47% (Third Class)
- Year 3: "Look how I grew" → Target 90%+ (Outstanding)

Same content, different frame. That's the difference.
