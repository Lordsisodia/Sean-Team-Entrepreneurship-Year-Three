# Year 2 Feedback Files

**Purpose:** Store all Year 2 coursework feedback for analysis and learning.

## What to Put Here

Please add any Year 2 feedback files you have, including:

1. **Marking Sheets** - Official grades and marker comments
2. **Tutor Feedback** - Written feedback from tutors/coaches
3. **Peer Reviews** - Feedback from teammates
4. **Assessment Reports** - Any formal assessment documents
5. **Email/Communications** - Any written feedback via email

## File Naming Convention

Please name files clearly so I can understand what they are:

- `marking-sheet.pdf` - Official marking/grades
- `tutor-feedback.docx` - Tutor written feedback
- `peer-review-NAME.txt` - Feedback from specific person
- `assessment-summary.pdf` - Overall assessment
- etc.

Use whatever names make sense - I'll analyze everything you provide.

## What I'll Do With These Files

Once you provide your Year 2 feedback, I will:

1. **Extract Positive Feedback** - What markers liked (do more of this)
2. **Extract Negative Feedback** - What markers criticized (fix these issues)
3. **Identify Patterns** - Recurring themes across multiple feedback sources
4. **Check for Improvement Areas** - Specific suggestions made by markers
5. **Compare Year 2 → Year 3** - Are you addressing previous feedback?
