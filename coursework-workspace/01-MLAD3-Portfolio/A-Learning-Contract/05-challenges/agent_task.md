## YEAR 2 FEEDBACK: PATTERNS TO AVOID

### Pattern 1: Vague vs Specific Struggles

**Bad (Vague):**
> "I need to improve my delegation skills."

**Good (Specific):**
> "When I delegated partnership outreach to Sam in September, I lasted 3 days before stepping back in. I felt anxious watching him make mistakes."

### Pattern 2: No Personal Accountability

**Bad (External blame):**
> "The team doesn't adopt my suggestions."

**Good (Personal accountability):**
> "My 40% adoption rate revealed that I provide recommendations but don't invest in understanding the team's perspective."

2. ✅ Each challenge passes "Personal Experience Test"
