## Marking Criteria (90-100% Outstanding)

### What Assessors Are Looking For

1. **Specific Challenges** - Honest identification
   - ❌ "I sometimes struggle with delegation" (understated)
   - ✅ "I struggle to delegate, resulting in bottlenecks and delayed projects"

2. **Evidence of Impact** - Real consequences
   - ❌ "My perfectionism can be challenging"
   - ✅ "My perfectionism caused a 6-week delay on my internal app while I refined features"

3. **Root Cause Awareness** - Not just symptoms
   - ❌ "I need to be more organized"
   - ✅ "My lack of systematic prioritization means I work on what feels urgent, not what's important"

4. **Connection to Growth** - Not static
   - ❌ Just listing problems
   - ✅ Identifying how Q4 competencies will address these

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- ❌ Vague, understated challenges
- ❌ No evidence of real impact
- ❌ Superficial treatment ("I work too hard")
- ❌ No connection to development plan
