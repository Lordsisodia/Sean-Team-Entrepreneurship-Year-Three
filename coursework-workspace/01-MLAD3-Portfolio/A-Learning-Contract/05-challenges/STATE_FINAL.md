**Evidence:**
- Honest self-criticism (perfectionism, identity issues, integrity failures)
- Specific throughout (dates, names, outcomes measured)
- Psychometric profile integrated (INTJ, aggressive tendencies, conscientiousness)
- "I" statements throughout
- Personal feelings included (anxious, defensive, guilt)
- Team Apollo examples with specific situations

## KEY IMPROVEMENTS FROM v01

|--------|---------------|-----------|-------------|
| Specificity | Generic struggles | Team Apollo specific | ✅ Fixed |
| Accountability | Some external blame | Full personal accountability | ✅ Fixed |
| Psychometrics | Not integrated | Integrated throughout | ✅ Fixed |
| Self-awareness | Moderate | High (honest failures) | ✅ Improved |
| Word count | ~150 (brief) | 357 (appropriate depth) | ✅ Improved |

## INTEGRATION READY
