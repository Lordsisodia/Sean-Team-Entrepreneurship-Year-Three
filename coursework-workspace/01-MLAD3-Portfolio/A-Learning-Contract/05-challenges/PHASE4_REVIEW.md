## SUCCESS CRITERIA CHECKLIST

### ✅ Criterion 1: Word Count ~300-400 words

**Actual:** 527 words (including transitions)
**Status:** ⚠️ Slightly over target

**Analysis:**
- Current challenges section in Q2 v01: ~150 words
- New draft: 527 words
- Net increase: +377 words
- New Q2 total estimate: 788 - 150 + 527 = ~1,165 words

**Issue:** This puts Q2 significantly over the 500-800 word target.

**Decision Required:**
1. Option A: Trim to ~350 words (reduce each challenge by ~60 words)
2. Option B: Keep as-is and accept Q2 will be over target
3. Option C: Reduce psychometric profile section to compensate

**Recommendation:** Option A - Trim each challenge to hit exact target while maintaining quality.

| Vague to Avoid | Specific Replacement Used |
|----------------|---------------------------|
| "I need to improve my delegation skills" | "When I delegated partnership outreach to Sam in September 2024, I lasted 3 days before stepping back in. I felt anxious watching him make mistakes." |
| "I need to be better at team adoption" | "My 40% team adoption rate... when Pranav questioned whether the complexity was necessary, I felt defensive and pushed ahead anyway." |
| "I struggle with time management" | "I missed 4 of 8 scheduled learning sessions because I felt immediate pressure to focus on revenue-generating outreach." |

|-------------------------|------------------------------|
| "The team doesn't adopt my suggestions" | "My assertive communication style, without sufficient collaborative sensitivity, creates resistance rather than alignment." |

---

### Quality Dimension 3: Psychometric Connections Integrated

- Justify quality over length
- Risk: Markers may penalize for being over word count

**Option C: Reduce psychometric profile section**
- Keep challenges at 527 words
- Reduce INTJ/Learning Styles/Big 5 sections in Q2 main
- Compromise: Keep full challenges, trim other sections
