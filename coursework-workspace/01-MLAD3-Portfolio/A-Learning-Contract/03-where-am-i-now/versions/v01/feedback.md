## CHANGES MADE

### 1. Team References Replaced
**Before:** Generic "Team Apollo" references
**After:** Specific team members (Sam, Leo, David, Harry)

**Examples:**
- "When Sam and I disagreed on the partnership framework..."

- "When I delivered harsh feedback to David..."
- "The speaking opportunity went to Harry, who used it to secure a partnership..."

### 2. Delegation Pattern Added
**Location:** Core Strengths - Working Under Pressure section
**Example:** Portfolio submission week (Dec 2024) - refused Sam's help, caused 2-day burnout delay
**Connection:** INTJ resistance to delegation under stress

### 3. Values Conflict Added
**Location:** Multi-Modal Learning section
**Example:** Spent 2 days building automation for 30-minute task
**Dilemma:** "Leverage beats immediate value" vs client responsibility
**Quote included:** "Leverage beats immediate value delivery every single time"

### 4. BlackBox Achievements Added
**Location:** INTJ Foundation section
**Content:** "BlackBox 5 & 6: first-of-its-kind open-source AI framework"
**Connection:** INTJ innovation strength, Temperament motivation

### 6. Honest Failures Added (9 total)
1. Oct 2024: Sam/partnership - 2 weeks lost (technical arrogance)
2. Sep 2024: 2-day automation for 30-min task (values conflict)
3. Sep 2024: David/partnership - 3 weeks disengagement (emotional blindness)
4. Nov 2024: Leo - 23 min domination (speaking over contribution)
5. Dec 2024: Portfolio - 2-day delay (no delegation)
6. Oct 2024: Learning vs recognition - partnership lost to Harry
7. Jan 2025: Partnership failure - emotional disconnection
8. Mar 2024: 6-week app vs Leo's launch (perfectionism)
9. Feb 2024: £15,000 ethics vs revenue loss

### 7. Ethical Dilemmas Added (3 total)
**Continuous Learning:** "Is it right to sacrifice current client value for future capability?"
**Strategic Excellence:** "Strategic thinking or procrastination disguised as quality standards?"
**Authentic Leadership:** "Principled stand or rigid self-righteousness?"

### 8. Balanced Strengths with Shadows
Every strength now has its corresponding weakness:
- Problem-Solving → Emotional blindness
- Public Speaking → Domination
- Working Under Pressure → Excessive independence
- High Emotional Stability → Emotional disconnection
- Versatile Learning → Undisciplined exploration

## KEY INSIGHT

**The rewrite transformation:**

**Before (60-68%):**
- Generic "Team Apollo" references
- "I'm good at problem-solving"
- Brief mention of limitations
- No ethical dilemmas
- Too positive

**After (90-100% target):**
- Specific team members (Sam/Leo/David/Harry)
- "My problem-solving strength caused me to overlook emotional impact when..."
- 9 specific failures with dates and outcomes
- 3 ethical dilemmas with unresolved questions
- Every strength balanced with its shadow

**The difference:** Same person, same capabilities, honest self-reflection instead of LinkedIn profile.
