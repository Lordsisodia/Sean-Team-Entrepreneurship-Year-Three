## Marking Criteria (90-100% Outstanding)

### What Assessors Are Looking For

**From the marking scheme:**
> "Detailed responses showing significant effort" and "high levels of self-awareness"

For Q2 specifically, this means:

1. **Psychometric Integration** - Not just listing results
   - ❌ "I am INTJ which means I am strategic"
   - ✅ "My INTJ preference for strategic thinking explains why I struggled with the rapid-fire decision-making required during..."

2. **Honest Self-Assessment** - Strengths AND weaknesses
   - ❌ "I'm good at many things but need to work on delegation"
   - ✅ "My strategic thinking is a strength (75 agent deployments), but I struggle with operational execution (6-week delay on internal app)"

3. **Specific Evidence** - Real examples
   - ❌ "I have improved my communication"
   - ✅ "Through the Partnership Framework, I achieved clarity in 4 agency conversations, though my closing rate remains at 25%"

4. **Self-Awareness About Privilege**
   - ❌ No mention of advantages
   - ✅ Recognition of privileged background, access to resources, etc.

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- ❌ **Generic psychometric descriptions** - Don't just define the terms
- ❌ **Only strengths, no weaknesses** - Must be honest about gaps
- ❌ **Vague self-assessment** - "I'm generally pretty good at..."
- ❌ **No connection to behaviour** - Traits should explain actual performance
- ❌ **Superficial treatment** - Quick mention without depth

### Outstanding vs. First-Class

| Aspect | First-Class (70-79%) | Outstanding (90-100%) |
|--------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Psychometric use | Listed and briefly described | Integrated and applied to real behaviour |
| Honesty | Some mention of weaknesses | Candid discussion of real challenges |
| Specificity | General statements | Specific examples with evidence |
| Self-awareness | Basic recognition | Deep insight into patterns and drivers |
| Values | Briefly mentioned | Explicitly stated and connected to goals |
