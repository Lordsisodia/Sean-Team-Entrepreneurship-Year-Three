## 🎯 NEXT STEPS

1. ✅ Extract your 6 competencies from Q4

3. ✅ Extract Activity Log content
4. ✅ Create organized folder structure
5. ✅ Populate each folder with your current content

## 📊 PORTFOLIO COUNT CLARIFICATION

You mentioned having "two portfolios" - this is likely:

1. **Main Portfolio** (portfolioy32025-26.pdf) - Your active Year 3 work
2. **Year 2 Portfolio** - Last year's completed work

The Year 2 portfolio should go in `06-Year-Two-Coursework/` for reference only.
