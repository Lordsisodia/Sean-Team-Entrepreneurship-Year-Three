## 🎯 MY ASSESSMENT OF YOUR CURRENT WORK

Based on the PDF, here's my honest assessment:

### STRENGTHS (70-79% level currently)
- Excellent writing quality and reflection
- Honest self-awareness (privilege reflection is powerful)
- Clear narrative arc across your journey
- Good understanding of your strengths and challenges
- Strong alignment between past experiences and current goals

### GAPS FOR 95% (What we need to add)
1. **More critical evaluation** - You describe well, but need more "why" and "how" analysis
2. **Specific examples** - More concrete details in challenges and successes
3. **Undertakings** - These are COMPLETELY MISSING and URGENT
4. **Activity Log completion** - Need Jan-Apr entries
5. **Exit strategy clarity** - Need more specificity on post-TE plans
6. **Storyboard planning** - Haven't started this major assignment

## 💡 WHAT ARE UNDERTAKINGS?

**LfO Undertaking (Learning from Others):**
Each needs:
- **Activity:** What you did (book read, event attended, course taken, workshop participated in)
- **Critical Evaluation:** What you learned, how it changed your thinking, what surprised you
- **Synthesis:** How it connects to other knowledge/sources
- **Application:** How you applied this learning to your practice
- **Validity:** Is the source credible? Why?

**LbD Undertaking (Learning by Doing):**
Each needs:
- **Activity:** What you did (hands-on project, venture work, team challenge)
- **Experience:** What happened, what was challenging, what went well
- **Reflection:** What you learned from doing it
- **Application:** How you've used this learning since
- **Future:** How this will inform your future actions

**Competency Undertaking:**
Each needs:
- **Competency Name:** Which one from TE Framework
- **Current Level:** Where you started
- **Target Level:** Where you want to be
- **Activities:** What you've done to develop it (workshops, practice, reading, mentoring)
- **Progress:** Evidence of growth
- **Reflection:** What you've learned about this competency

## 📝 NEXT STEPS

**I need from you:**

1. **Tell me your 6 competencies** (from Q4 in Learning Contract)
   - Or I can extract them from your PDF if they're there

2. **List 3 LfO activities** you've done since September
   - Books read?
   - Events attended?
   - Workshops participated in?
   - Networking events?
   - Online courses?
   - Mentoring sessions?

3. **List 3 LbD activities** you've done since September
   - Project work?
   - Venture activities?
   - Team challenges?
   - Client work?
   - Any hands-on entrepreneurial activity?

4. **List progress on each competency**
   - What activities have you done for each?
   - What evidence of growth do you have?
   - What's your current level now?

**Once you give me this information, I will:**
- Write all your Undertakings for you
- Ensure they meet the Outstanding (90-100%) criteria
- Connect them to your exit strategy
- Make them critical and reflective, not descriptive
