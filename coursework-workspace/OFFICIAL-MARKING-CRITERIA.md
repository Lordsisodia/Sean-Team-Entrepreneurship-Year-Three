### 90-100% OUTSTANDING CRITERIA

#### Evidence of Self-Managed Learning (60% of assignment)

**What they require:**
> "All or most components of the Portfolio of Self-leadership have been completed according to assignment instructions. Significant effort has been made showing detailed responses to the Learning Contract questions, Change Log and Feedback and Response."

## 🎯 FOR UNDERTAKINGS SPECIFICALLY

While Undertakings aren't separately marked, they contribute to:
1. **Evidence of Self-Managed Learning** (60%)
2. **Final Analysis** (40%) - when you reflect on what you learned

### What Makes Undertakings "Outstanding" (90-100%):

#### 1. LfO Undertakings (Learning from Others)

**For Outstanding quality:**

**Critical Evaluation Section:**
- Not just "what I learned"
- **What challenged my assumptions?**
- **What surprised me?**
- **How did it change my thinking?**

**Synthesis Section:**
- **Connection to other sources/topics**
- **Alignment or conflict with prior learning**
- **Integration with theory or frameworks**

**Application Section:**
- **Specific examples from my practice**
- **Concrete evidence** (not "I would use this" but "I used this")
- **Impact on ventures/projects/team**

**Validity Section:**
- **Source credibility assessment** (why is this source trustworthy?)
- **Strengths AND limitations** (balanced view)
- **Relevance to my context**

#### 2. LbD Undertakings (Learning by Doing)

**For Outstanding quality:**

**Experience Section:**
- **What was challenging** (not just what went well)
- **Unexpected outcomes**
- **Honest reflection** (including failures)

**Reflection Section:**
- **What I learned from doing** (not just what I did)
- **Connection to theory** (why did this work/not work?)
- **Skills developed** (specific capabilities)

**Application Section:**

#### 3. Competency Undertakings

**For Outstanding quality:**

**Progress Evidence:**
- **Before/after comparison** (specific examples)
- **Multiple activities** (3+ different activities)
- **Measurable improvement** (not just "I improved")

**Development Activities:**
- **Range of learning methods** (workshops, mentoring, practice, reading)
- **Timeline showing growth** (not just "I did this" but "I developed over time")

**Reflection Section:**
- **What this competency means to me** (personal understanding)
- **How it supports my exit strategy**

## ⚠️ COMMON PITFALLS TO AVOID

### Description vs Critical Evaluation:
**❌ Not Outstanding:** "I read a book about leadership and learned good strategies."
**✅ Outstanding:** "This book challenged my assumption that leadership means being in charge. I realized my approach with Team Apollo was directive rather than collaborative, explaining the 40% adoption rate. This connects to Situational Leadership Theory (Hersey, 1969), which suggests..."

### Vague vs Specific Application:
**❌ Not Outstanding:** "I will use this learning in my future partnerships."
**✅ Outstanding:** "I applied the partnership framework from this workshop to design my pilot testing approach with 10 agencies. Specifically, I created the white-label system package that addresses the 'mutual benefit' requirement identified in the workshop. This directly supports my Service Design & Delivery competency goal of 100 validated partnerships by January 2026."

### Superficial vs In-Depth:
**❌ Not Outstanding:** "This was a valuable learning experience that helped me grow."
**✅ Outstanding:** "This experience revealed a critical gap in my understanding: I was prioritizing technical perfection over strategic progress. The 6-week delay on my internal app, while partnership apps remained incomplete, cost me potential first-mover advantage in the AI automation market. This directly relates to my Self-Management competency challenge of 'managing multiple priorities without systematic prioritization.'"

## ✅ OUTSTANDING CHECKLIST FOR UNDERTAKINGS

For each Undertaking, ask:

- [ ] **Is it specific?** (Concrete details, not general statements)
- [ ] **Is it honest?** (Includes challenges and failures, not just successes)
- [ ] **Is it connected?** (Links to my Learning Contract, objectives, competencies)
- [ ] **Is it evaluative?** (Critical analysis, not just description)
- [ ] **Is it applied?** (Real examples from my actual work)
- [ ] **Is it reflective?** (Shows self-awareness and growth)
- [ ] **Is it valid?** (Source is credible, relevance is explained)

## 🎯 FOR 95% TARGET

Your Undertakings need to show:

1. **Integration:** Connect everything to your exit strategy (1,000 partnerships)
2. **Honesty:** Acknowledge your real challenges (delegation, time management, revenue)
3. **Depth:** Go beyond surface description to analyze WHY and HOW
4. **Evidence:** Use real examples from your actual work
5. **Growth:** Show how you've developed from Year 2 to Year 3
6. **Alignment:** Every Undertaking supports at least one competency and one objective
