## 🎯 HOW TO ANSWER

**For each question, provide:**

1. **The Source** (book, workshop, article, video, conversation, etc.)
2. **When** (approximate month or timeframe)
3. **One Key Insight** (what surprised you or changed your thinking)
4. **One Application** (how you used or will use it)

**Format example:**
> "Source: Book called 'The Mom Test' about customer discovery
> When: October 2025
> Insight: I was building solutions without talking to customers
> Application: Changed my approach to pilot testing partnerships before building full systems"

**Don't worry about making it perfect** - rough bullet points are fine. I'll craft them into Outstanding-quality Undertakings.
