## ⚠️ COMMON PITFALLS

**❌ Not Outstanding:**
```
I attended a workshop on sales. It was really good and I learned a lot.
The speaker was knowledgeable and I took good notes. I will use this in my business.
```

**✅ Outstanding:**
```
LfO Undertaking: Advanced Sales Workshop with Tom Hopkins (Oct 15)

Context: With zero partnerships and weak communication skills (Q2), I identified
sales as a critical gap. My Q4 competency development goal is "influencing stakeholders."
I chose this intensive workshop to address this gap systematically.

Action Taken: 8-hour workshop focused on consultative selling methodologies.
Learned the Sandler Selling System: question-driven approach, upfront contracts,
negative reverse selling. Practiced role-playing with 5 other entrepreneurs.
Received direct feedback from Tom on my tendency to "pitch too early."

Critical Evaluation: The workshop challenged my assumption that selling is about
persuasion. I learned it's about qualification and disqualification. My initial
role-plays were mediocre - I kept jumping to solutions instead of understanding
pain points. Tom's feedback was direct: "You're solving problems they don't have."
I struggled with the negative reverse technique but after 4 attempts, started
seeing breakthrough moments in conversations.

However, I didn't fully implement the upfront contract technique. I found it
awkward and avoided it. This is a pattern - I resist structured communication
when it feels inauthentic. I need to work on this.

Learning Achieved: Shifted from "persuasion" mindset to "qualification" mindset.
Learned to ask better questions: "What's the cost of not solving this problem?"
instead of "Would you like our solution?" Applied immediately to agency outreach -
response rate doubled from 15% to 30% when I focused on problems instead of solutions.

Direct connection to Q4 Professional Communication competency. Also improved
Strategic Leadership - I'm now teaching Sam these techniques.

Future Application: Continue practicing Sandler methodology in all partnership
conversations. Track metrics: meeting booking rate, objection handling success,
deal velocity. Plan advanced negotiation workshop for February.

## 📈 COMPETENCY INTEGRATION

**Self-Management:** 2-3 undertakings on prioritization, organization, efficiency
**Entrepreneurial Judgment:** 2-3 undertakings on strategic decisions, trade-offs

Each competency should have at least one dedicated Competency Undertaking, plus
additional development through LfO and LbD undertakings.

## 🔍 HONEST REFLECTION INDICATORS

**Outstanding Undertakings Include:**
- Times you failed or struggled (not just successes)
- What you would do differently
- Resistance to feedback or new approaches
- Mistakes you made and what they taught you
- Gaps in your skills or knowledge
- Discomfort or growth moments
- Specific feedback received from others

**Example:**
```
What I'd Do Differently: I spent 3 weeks building the partnership CRM before
talking to a single agency. This was backwards - I should have done 20 manual
partnerships first to understand the workflow, then automated what actually worked.
I got seduced by building instead of selling. I recognized this pattern from my
app development failure in September. I need to force myself to validate before
building every time.
```
