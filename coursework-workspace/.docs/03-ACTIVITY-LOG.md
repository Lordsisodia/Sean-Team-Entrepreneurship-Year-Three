## 🔍 HONEST REFLECTION INDICATORS

**Outstanding Activity Logs Include:**
- What went wrong, not just what went right
- Specific metrics and data (not just "it went well")
- Unexpected challenges and how you addressed them
- Feedback received and actions taken
- Changes in direction based on learning
- Acknowledgment of time wasted on wrong priorities

**Example of Honest Reflection:**
```
Challenge: Spent 2 weeks building agency directory features that nobody wanted
Reflection: I was solving the wrong problem - agencies don't need another directory,
they need validated partnership opportunities
Time lost: 80 hours of development work
Lesson learned: Validate assumptions before building
Action: Pivoted to manual outreach first, automate later based on real workflows
```

## 📈 PROGRESSION STANDARDS

Outstanding Activity Logs show clear progression over 8 months:

**September-October:** Foundation building, lots of experimentation
**November-December:** Initial wins, learning from failures, refining approach
**January-February:** Scaling what works, measurable progress toward objectives
