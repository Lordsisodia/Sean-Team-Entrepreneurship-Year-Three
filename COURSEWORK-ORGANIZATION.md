## ✅ STRUCTURE CORRECTIONS MADE

### 1. Teams Data Location
**✅ Fixed:** Teams data is now in `/Teams-Data/` at the root level
**Reason:** Teams data is supporting evidence, not coursework itself

### 2. Learning Contract Planning
**✅ Already Correct:** Your `learning-contract-planning/` folder is at root level
**Contains:** Your planning documents, strategies, assessments
**This is proper:** Planning is separate from active coursework workspace

### 3. Year Two Coursework
**✅ Already Correct:** Your `year-two-coursework/` folder is at root level
**Contains:** Your completed Year 2 portfolio and components
**This is proper:** Previous year's work is reference material
