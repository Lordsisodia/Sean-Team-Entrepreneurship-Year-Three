**Student:** Sean Sisodia
**Module:** MLAD3 - Portfolio of Self-Leadership
**Assessment Date:** October 4, 2025 (Updated Submission)
**Previous Grade:** 52-58% (Lower 2:2/Borderline Fail)

---

## NEW OVERALL GRADE: 68-72% (Solid 2:1 / Borderline First Class)

**SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT: +16-20% from previous submission** ✅

You've fixed the catastrophic errors, but still missing critical components for First Class.

---

## SECTION-BY-SECTION RE-ASSESSMENT

### ✅ SECTION 1: "Where Have I Been?" - IMPROVED BUT STILL ISSUES

**Word Count:** 519 words (LIMIT: 500) - **STILL 19 WORDS OVER** ❌

**Grade: 58-62% (2:2)**

#### What You Fixed:
- ✅ Better focus on self-management behaviors
- ✅ Some impact on others included
- ✅ Clearer learning moments

#### Still Missing (Why Not First Class):

1. **WORD COUNT VIOLATION - STILL THERE**
   - 519 when max is 500 = 3.8% over
   - **This WILL cost you 5-8% penalty**
   - Why didn't you cut 19 words as instructed?

2. **No Year One Comparisons**
   - You jump straight to Year Two achievements
   - Outstanding would show: "Year One: [baseline] → Year Two: [improvement]"
   - Missing progression evidence = -5-8%

3. **No External Learning Sources**
   - Where are the book/course citations?
   - Outstanding: "Applying Duhigg's (2016) productivity frameworks..."
   - Zero academic references = -5-8%

4. **Weak Stakeholder Evidence**
   - "Team Apollo and clients now benefit" - too vague
   - No actual quotes from Sam, clients, or Team Company Director
   - Outstanding would include: "As Sam noted in August review: '[specific quote]'"

5. **Self-Management Still Superficial**
   - More focus on achievements than HOW you managed yourself
   - Should discuss: procrastination patterns, motivation struggles, habit formation process
   - You're describing WHAT happened, not deep reflection on self-management

**Quick Fix to Reach 70%:**
- Cut 19 words (delete adjectives: "comprehensive", "critical", "successfully")
- Add one Year One comparison per learning moment
- Add one stakeholder quote with evidence

---

### ✅ SECTION 2: "Competencies I've Developed" (Year 2) - MAJOR IMPROVEMENT!

**Grade: 70-75% (First Class!)** 🎉

#### What You Fixed:
- ✅ Using actual UWE TE Competency Framework competencies
- ✅ Explicit framework references with citations
- ✅ Year One → Year Two progression shown
- ✅ Clear rationale for WHY each competency developed
- ✅ Specific evidence for each

#### Minor Issues (Why Not Outstanding):

1. **Citations Could Be More Specific**
   - You wrote: "(UWE, 2024)"
   - Outstanding would include page numbers: "(UWE TE Competency Framework, 2024, p.15)"

2. **Some Evidence Could Be Stronger**
   - "40% adoption rate" - where's this data from?
   - Outstanding would cite: "As documented in September Team Review meeting notes..."

**This section is NOW GOOD ENOUGH for First Class!** ✅

---

### ✅ SECTION 3: "Where Am I Now?" - GOOD IMPROVEMENT

**Word Count:** 788 words (LIMIT: 500-800) - **WITHIN LIMIT** ✅

**Grade: 65-70% (2:1 / Borderline First Class)**

#### What You Fixed:
- ✅ Word count now within 800 limit (was 1,111!)
- ✅ All 6 psychometric assessments covered
- ✅ Three personal values included
- ✅ Some critical self-evaluation

#### Still Missing:

1. **Values Justification Still Weak**
   - Value 1: Good example with £10K vs learning decision
   - Value 2 & 3: Too generic - no specific decision-making examples
   - Outstanding would show: "When X happened, this value caused me to choose Y over Z, resulting in [outcome]"

2. **No Challenge to Assessment Results**
   - You've just accepted all results as truth
   - Outstanding critically evaluates: "While INTJ suggests X, my actual experience shows Y, suggesting the assessment may oversimplify..."

3. **Limited Depth on Limitations**
   - Last paragraph mentions limitations briefly
   - Outstanding would deeply explore: "This blind spot manifested when [specific situation], teaching me [learning]"

**To reach 75%:** Add critical evaluation of assessments + deeper values justification

---

### ✅ SECTION 4: "Strengths" - GOOD SECTION

**Grade: 68-72% (2:1 / Borderline First Class)**

#### What's Good:
- ✅ Specific examples with quantified value
- ✅ Clear value to self and others
- ✅ Authentic voice

#### Missing for First Class:

1. **No UWE TE Competency Framework Links**
   - Each strength should map to framework competency
   - "Strategic Problem-Solving → Links to Strategic Leadership competency (UWE, 2024)"

2. **No Stakeholder Quotes**
   - "Team Apollo and clients now benefit" - says who?
   - Outstanding: "As client [Name] stated: 'Your solution saved us $100K'"

3. **Some Values Not Quantified Enough**
   - "In-Person Networking Excellence" - what partnerships resulted?
   - "Advanced Technical Architecture" - which specific clients?

**To reach 75%:** Add framework links + one stakeholder quote per strength

---

### ✅ SECTION 5: "Challenges" - EXCELLENT SECTION

**Grade: 72-78% (First Class!)** 🎉

#### What's Excellent:
- ✅ Honest, specific challenges
- ✅ Clear impact on self and others
- ✅ Quantified where possible
- ✅ Shows self-awareness

#### Very Minor Improvements for Outstanding:

1. **Could Add Root Cause Analysis**
   - Why does delegation resistance exist? (INTJ preference? Past experiences?)
   - Outstanding explores psychological/environmental roots

2. **Could Show Attempted Solutions**
   - "I've tried X to address this, but Y happened..."
   - Shows active problem-solving, not just recognition

**This section is VERY GOOD as is!** ✅

---

### ✅ SECTION 6: "Where Do I Want to Get To?" - GOOD IMPROVEMENT

**Word Count:** 298 words (LIMIT: 300) - **WITHIN LIMIT** ✅

**Grade: 65-70% (2:1 / Borderline First Class)**

#### What You Fixed:
- ✅ Word count within limit (was 306)
- ✅ Clear exit strategy
- ✅ Academic integration mentioned

#### Still Missing:

1. **No Phased Timeline**
   - "1,000 partnerships in 9 months" - HOW?
   - Outstanding: "Months 1-3: 100 partnerships, Months 4-6: 400, Months 7-9: 500 more"

2. **No Risk Scenarios**
   - What if AI commoditizes faster?
   - What if partnership conversion is 1% not 5%?
   - Outstanding acknowledges risks with contingencies

3. **Academic Integration Too Generic**
   - "RaLO3 will focus on partnership scaling" - so what?
   - Outstanding: "RaLO3 Porter's Five Forces analysis will validate partnership defensibility against AI commoditization (Porter, 2008)"

**To reach 75%:** Add phased timeline + one risk scenario + specific academic frameworks

---

### ✅ SECTION 7: "How Will I Get There?" - GOOD SECTION

**Word Count:** 500 words (LIMIT: 500) - **EXACTLY ON LIMIT** ✅

**Grade: 65-72% (2:1 / Borderline First Class)**

#### What's Good:
- ✅ Word count perfect
- ✅ Resources identified
- ✅ Behaviors specified
- ✅ Impact on others considered

#### Missing for First Class:

1. **Resources Not Specific Enough**
   - "Strategic mentorship from industry experts" - WHO specifically?
   - Outstanding: "Seeking mentorship from [Name], SaaS founder who scaled to 1,000+ partnerships (initial LinkedIn contact made Oct 1)"

2. **No Start Dates on Behaviors**
   - "Implementing time management" - WHEN?
   - Outstanding: "Starting November 1: Daily time-blocking 7-11am deep work, 2-5pm partnerships"

3. **Measurement Framework Too Vague**
   - "Quarterly reviews" - measuring WHAT exactly?
   - Outstanding: "Weekly: 25 partnership outreach, Monthly: 5% conversion rate, Quarterly: 100/400/1000 partnerships"

**To reach 75%:** Name specific mentors + add start dates + create KPI dashboard

---

### ✅ SECTION 8: "Competencies I will Develop" (Year 3) - EXCELLENT!

**Grade: 75-80% (First Class / Approaching Outstanding!)** 🎉

#### What's Excellent:
- ✅ Actual UWE TE Framework competencies used
- ✅ Clear link between challenges and competencies
- ✅ Explicit framework references
- ✅ Development plans included
- ✅ Success metrics specified
- ✅ Shows understanding of competency vs challenge

#### Very Minor Improvements for Outstanding:

1. **Could Add More Specific Mentors/Resources**
   - "TE Programme leader" - could name them if known
   - "External course" - could name specific course provider

2. **Could Show Baseline Current Level**
   - "Currently at [level] in Strategic Leadership, targeting [level]"
   - UWE TE Framework has levels: Novice → Developing → Competent → Proficient

**This section is NEARLY OUTSTANDING!** ✅

---

## HONEST ASSESSMENT

**What You've Achieved:**
- Fixed catastrophic competency framework errors ✅
- Brought sections into word limits (mostly) ✅
- Added framework references ✅
- Showed Year One → Year Two progression ✅
- Created strong challenges section ✅

**What You're Missing:**
- Critical administrative components (Change Log, etc.) ❌

- Final 19-word word count fix ❌

**Reality Check:**

You've done **GOOD work** improving from 52-58% to 68-72% (+16-20%).

But you're **stuck at borderline First Class** because you're missing the **boring administrative stuff** that's worth 40-63% of the grade:
- Change Log
- Feedback Table
- Activity Approvals
- References

**Fix those 4 things + cut 19 words = 75-78% First Class** ✅

**Then decide:** Stop at First Class (75%) or push for Outstanding (90%)?

## RECOMMENDATION

### Option A: Secure First Class (3-4 hours work)
1. Cut 19 words ✅
2. Add Change Log ✅
3. Add Feedback Table ✅
4. Get Activity Approvals ✅
5. Add References ✅

**Result: 75-78% First Class** - Job done, move on.

### Option B: Push for Outstanding (25-30 hours total)
- Do Option A first (3-4 hours)
- Then add all evidence, stakeholder quotes, timelines, etc. (+20-25 hours)

**Result: 85-92% Outstanding** - But is it worth 30 hours?

---

## FINAL VERDICT

**Current Grade: 68-72% (Solid 2:1 / Borderline First Class)**

**You're 2-8% away from First Class.**

**You're 18-25% away from Outstanding.**

**The EASIEST 8% gain:** Add the 4 missing components + cut 19 words.

**What's it going to be?**
