## 🚨 CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

### 1. Build Foundation First
**Never skip Learning Contract Q1-Q4.**
Everything else depends on this narrative.

### 2. Competencies Drive Everything
**All undertakings must develop your 6 competencies.**
If an undertaking doesn't develop a competency, why are you doing it?

### 3. SMART Objectives Guide Activity
**All undertakings must support SMART objectives.**
If an activity doesn't advance an objective, it's wasted effort.

### 4. LfO Before LbD
**Learn first, then apply.**
You can't do what you don't know.

### 5. Document in Real-Time
**Activity log monthly, not at end.**
Authenticity matters. Backdating is obvious and lowers quality.

---

## 📈 QUALITY TARGET: 95-100% (Outstanding)

### What Outstanding Requires:

**Foundation (Learning Contract):**
- In-depth critical evaluation
- High self-awareness
- Honest assessment (strengths AND weaknesses)
- Clear narrative arc
- Specific examples with evidence

**Planning (SMART Objectives):**
- Specific, measurable metrics

**Execution (Undertakings):**
- Per-source validity assessments

### 2. Foundation is Empty
**Learning Contract Q1-Q4 needs to be built.**
This is the highest leverage work.

### 3. Everything Flows From Foundation
**Get Q1-Q4 right, and everything else is easier.**
Get it wrong, and you'll redo everything.

### 4. This is a System, Not a Checklist
**Components connect and reinforce each other.**
Build with the whole system in mind.
