## Portfolio Introduction

This is my Learning Portfolio where I capture my objectives, plans and the standards I will set for myself within the Team Entrepreneurship Programme. I share my portfolio with my Team Company, to whom I am accountable, and from whom I gain support.

It is a "living document" that I continually update to measure and evidence my progress and success. It is a tool for learning, shared with my Team and my Coach.

## Personal Image Description
