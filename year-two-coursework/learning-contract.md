## Where Have I Been? (500 words)

Over the past year, I encountered transformative learning moments that reshaped my approach as a self-managed learner and business leader. Below, I evaluate five key experiences from Year 1, highlighting successes, challenges, and their impact on my self-leadership and others.

### Onboarding Interns and Leadership Growth
Onboarding interns was pivotal for my leadership development. Initially, delegating tasks was challenging due to a perfectionist mindset, fearing quality would suffer. By establishing clear guidelines and incorporating feedback sessions, inspired by Kolb's Experiential Learning Cycle, I turned this into an opportunity. Realizing low-level tasks could be automated, I implemented tools that reduced manual work by 30%, freeing 10 hours weekly for strategic tasks. This enhanced my self-leadership by teaching me to trust others and influence team dynamics, boosting output and fostering mentorship.

### Building Meaningful Connections
Cultivating relationships beyond conventional networking was transformative. I converted two crypto investors into agency clients, generating £5,000 in revenue, and a connection with my flatmate's brother, a software entrepreneur, provided AI industry insights. Early inconsistent follow-ups cost opportunities, but I developed a CRM system to stay engaged. This strengthened my self-leadership through strategic networking, broadening my vision and enabling market breakthroughs for my team.

Initially overwhelmed by complex AI coding, I committed to studying shared documents, speeding up our development process by 20%. These exchanges underscored the urgency of integrating AI solutions, keeping us competitive. This experience honed my self-leadership by fostering a growth mindset and proactive learning, benefiting my team's innovation.

### Embracing Technology and Automation
Leading AI and automation integration cut operational costs by 15% and improved delivery speed. Team resistance to new tools was a hurdle, but I overcame it with training sessions, promoting adaptability. This shift fostered a culture of continuous improvement, reducing reliance on manual processes. My self-leadership grew through innovation and resilience, driving team efficiency and scalability.

### Enhancing Time Management and Adaptability
Facing tight deadlines, I refined time management through trial-and-error, experimenting with prioritization tools. Early frustrations with ineffective methods taught me resilience, raising my task completion rate from 70% to 90%. This allowed me to manage workloads independently, reducing team dependency and enabling focus on automation. This strengthened my self-leadership by improving prioritization and adaptability under pressure.

Reflecting on these experiences, Year 1 was a journey of growth and adaptation. From trusting others during onboarding to leveraging connections and embracing technology, each moment enhanced my self-leadership, improving team productivity and innovation. These lessons solidified my commitment to continuous learning, ensuring I nurture relationships, lead dynamically, and refine strategies to drive success and support my team's growth.
