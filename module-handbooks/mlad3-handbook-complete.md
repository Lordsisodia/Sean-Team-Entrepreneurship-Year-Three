## 1. Introducing the Self-Leadership Strand

The Team Entrepreneurship (TE) Programme has four "strands", which include modules and programme activities. The Managing my Learning and Development module sits within the Self-Leadership strand. The same module occurs at each year level, however the complexity and range of the assignments are different.

The purpose of 'Self-Leadership' is to intentionally influence your thinking, feelings and actions toward achieving your goals. It incorporates developing an enterprising and entrepreneurial mindset and being able to manage yourself in an appropriate and effective manner. To do this, you need self-directed learning skills. A self-directed learner engages in a process where they take the initiative, with or without the help of others, in diagnosing their learning needs, formulating learning goals, identifying human and material resources for learning, choosing and implementing appropriate learning strategies, and evaluating learning outcomes (Knowles, 1975).

### 1.1 Progression

Throughout the Self-Leadership Strand you are required to:

- Set and agree personal learning and development goals that build enterprising and entrepreneurial competence.
- Take responsibility for managing their own learning and development.
- Support the learning and development of others.
- Give and receive feedback.
- Engage with others in the UWE Team Academy and beyond to build a personal network.
- Adopt professional behaviours and practices to manage personal conduct in a manner that is in accordance with stated personal values.
- Maintain records and report on individual activities and conduct to external stakeholders including the University and the UWE Team Academy.

### 1.2 Expectations at each year

**Year 1:**
You will become a self-directed learner, taking the initiative to identify your learning needs, create your own goals, and track progression. Understanding your successes and challenges through reflection and receiving feedback. Supporting others through giving constructive feedback. Forming self-awareness and awareness of your influence on others through understanding your values, ethics, habits, practices and behaviours.

**Year 2:**
You will demonstrate the attributes and behaviours you recognise will lead you and your Team Company to success, whilst working towards your area of specialism. Focusing on your ability to build relationships with your team, customers and stakeholders, through developing emotional intelligence. Applying mentoring & coaching skills within your communities to share knowledge and increase your ability to challenge each other's perceptions in a constructive way, supporting your Team Company strategy. Utilising professional frameworks to measure progression of enterprising and entrepreneurship competencies, you undertake self-managed learning that works towards your specialism.

**Year 3:**
You will have the ability to express informed perspectives and make informed decisions towards your exit strategy. Engaging in constructive feedback conversations, you will utilise high levels of self-awareness and personal accountability to build long-lasting relationships. You will demonstrate your competence within your enterprise and entrepreneurship specialism towards your exit strategy. The journey of self-mastery starts here and continues throughout your life.

## 2. Resources

The reading list for this module can be accessed online here. Remember, this forms part of your Learning from Others activities, so ensure you evidence this appropriately, for example by completing a Learning from Others Undertaking within your Personal Portfolio once you have read a book/article.

We encourage you to use other forms of learning such as workshops tailored to this module. You can find a list of workshops in the TE-Calendar here.

Find other resources including UWE TE Competency Framework in this helpful guide here.

### AI in the context of Team Entrepreneurship

Detailed guidelines for Team Entrepreneurs can be found here. Specific guidance will be given for each assignment by Module Leaders. Overall, TE assignments align to using AI in an assistive role, for example:

- providing ideas or inspiration related to an assignment topic, as a starting point;
- structuring content;
- identifying sources of information related to a topic, e.g. thought leaders, authors, theory, frameworks, etc, to inform further reading from original/other sources.

**Remember to:**
- Avoid Plagiarism (Academic Offence) and do not copy AI-generated text directly into your assignments;
- Write in your own words and cite sources properly;
- Go to the sources AI suggests and read further;
- Check Facts by always verifying the information AI provides, as it may be inaccurate or outdated, this includes the sources it suggests.
- Reference any outputs as personal communication or an image.
- Be critical and aware of the limitations and biases AI has.

For further details, check UWE guidance and principles for using AI in your assignments.

### UWE Support

- UWE Bristol offer a range of Assessment Support Options that you can explore through this link, and both Academic Support and Wellbeing Support are available. For further information, please see the Student study essentials.
- If you are an enrolled student you have agreed to abide by the University's academic regulations and procedures. Find out what the Disability Service and Access and Learning Strategies (ALS) team offer. Are you eligible for Reasonable Adjustments? Follow the link to find out more.

## 3. Assessment and Learning Outcomes

In the Managing My Learning and Development module, assessment is focussed on evaluating your ability to mobilise yourself toward self-defined, agreed and required goals (Programme Learning Outcome 2). Assessment evaluates the quality and relevance of the learning goals and planned activities, achievements made and learning from reflection.

Assessment includes two types of assignment. The first requires you to plan and manage your learning and evaluate your performance through a portfolio. The second assignment requires a reflection (Storyboard) on how people in general, and you in particular, lead and develop yourself, focusing on your experiences over the programme.

### Learning Outcomes - On successful completion of this module you will be able to:

1. Make a critically informed judgement of your own future development needs, including within areas of specialism.
2. Give effective feedback and critically evaluate feedback received.
3. Plan and undertake effective self-managed learning, including within areas of specialism.
4. Demonstrate high levels of self-awareness and personal accountability through reflection on learning.
5. Express informed personal perspectives on professional values, ethics, practices and behaviours.

### 4.1.1 Why this Assignment?

A Learning Contract is:

*"A personal plan that commits the learner to develop [their] knowledge … it is a contract with which the learner agrees with the team about the objective that must be achieved. The learning contract tells the other participants – as well as the coaches – what the learner's intentions are, how they will achieve them, and how the results are measured. In this way others can support him, her or they in their effort."* (The Team Coach's Best Tools – Johannes Partanen)

The learning approach adopted for this assignment follows Kolb's Experiential Learning Cycle to foster the development of self-directed learners (refer to Overview of the Process diagram). As a Team Entrepreneur, you will navigate multiple cycles throughout the year. Creating objectives, taking action (experimenting/experiencing), reflecting on performance, conceptualising learning, and back to implementation again. Your Personal Portfolio provides a platform to document this iterative process by evidencing planning, action and reflection – ultimately capturing the learning experience.

Throughout your professional career, target setting is an integral part of measuring performance, therefore it is a critical skill to develop now.

Many Team Entrepreneur graduates still use some form of Learning Contract to support their continuing development. All Team Coaches maintain their own Learning Contracts which are reviewed by the Coaches' team.

### 4.1.2 What do You Need to Know to do this Assignment?

- How to set SMART Objectives (refer to Module Reading List)
- How to give and receive feedback
- How to manage workload effectively
- How to do reflective writing (refer to UWE's reflective writing resource)
- How to use PebblePad:

#### Learning Contract, Objectives and Formative Feedback:

From **Monday 29th September** (after Starting Block) you can get going with your Learning Contract and SMART Objectives.

By **Monday 27th October** you would have completed your Learning Contract (4 questions), created your 6 Objectives, undertaken a Team Company Review of your objectives and captured feedback from at least 2 team members in the portfolio.

By the **end of November**, you'll have had a one-to-one with your Team Coach to gain Formative Feedback on your Learning Contract and Objectives to ensure you are focusing on the most important learning opportunities relevant to you. Any feedback you collect, you should add this to your feedback table in the portfolio.

By **Monday 26th January 2026**, you would have updated your Objectives and gained feedback from 2 or more of your teammates.

The final Team Company Review of Objectives will need to be between **Monday 23rd March and Thursday 26th March 2026**.

The 5th question of the Learning Contract is to be completed by the final submission of the portfolio **Monday 27th April 2026**.

#### LfO, LbD and Competency Undertakings:

From September onwards, evidence your learning by creating LfO, LbD, and Competency Undertakings. By **Friday 16th January 2026**, you should have completed 3 LfO Undertakings and 3 LbD Undertakings, as well as made progress on all your Competency Undertakings.

Your Team Coach will provide Formative Feedback in a Training Session on themes emerging from a range of Undertakings reviewed. This will happen **Monday 2nd February to Thursday 5th February 2026**.

#### Activity Log:

Every month, from September to the end of April, update your Activities Log in the portfolio. Your actions should be tailored to the desires you've set out in your Learning Contract. Ensure you have at least 2 meaningful actions completed for Practice and 2 for Enquiry.

The Team Company holds accountability for this work being undertaken. In an allocated Training Session, team members review each other's portfolio to check if the work has been done. If it has this gets marked as completed on the Activity Log Approval tracker. There are 2 chances to complete the task. This should be reviewed in the next available Training Session.

#### By the final submission (Monday 27th April 2026) you should have completed:

1. **Learning Contract** – 5 reflective answers to 5 questions (4 at the start of the year, 5th question at the end of the year).
2. **SMART Objectives** – 6 current objectives across 3 focus areas of self/team/projects, with progress ratings.
3. Changes to your Objectives and Learning Contract are recorded in the **Change Log**.
4. **3 Team Company Reviews** of your Objectives, including peer feedback with your responses.
5. **2 Formative Feedback** opportunities from your Team Coach.
6. **8 Monthly Activity Log Approvals** from your Team Company, supported with activity logs for each month.
7. **6 Undertakings for LfO, 6 Undertakings for LbD and 6 Competency Undertakings** (the quality is assessed in other modules).

**IMPORTANT:** Please read further details on the requirements of each section above in Appendix 1.

### 4.1.4 Marking Criteria

In the table on the following page, you will find the marking criteria for this assessment. All the modules explain what is expected of you to reach a range of marks. The categories range from No Meaningful Attempt to Outstanding.

Do note that the following table is indicative, there are no absolutes and always require a certain amount of interpretation by the marker(s). All markers are supported by the module leaders to ensure that the marking criteria are correctly interpreted and to ensure consistency, and 10% of all assignments and all marks marginal fail and below, are moderated.

#### MARKING CRITERIA TABLE - PORTFOLIO OF SELF-LEADERSHIP

| Grading System % | **Evidence of Self-Managed Learning** (Learning Contract 4 questions, Objectives, Feedback and Response) **60%** | **Final Analysis** (Learning Contract 5th Question) **40%** |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1st 90-100% Outstanding** | All or most components of the Portfolio of Self-leadership have been completed according to assignment instructions. Significant effort has been made showing detailed responses to the Learning Contract questions, Change Log and Feedback and Response. | An in-depth critical evaluation of how Self-leadership activities have led to key learning about personal habits and behaviours, demonstrating high levels of self-awareness and personal accountability. Evaluation includes consideration of what your plans were and where you reached. Critically informed judgment has led to significant future plans based on this reflection. |
| **1st 80-89% Exceptional** | [Same as Outstanding] | [Same as Outstanding] |
| **1st 70-79% Excellent** | [Same as Outstanding] | [Same as Outstanding] |
| **2.1 60-69% Good** | Most components have been completed according to assignment instructions. However, there may be areas missing such as Approval, Team Company Review and feedback/response and limited reflection in the Learning Contract. Further detail could have been included at times. Potentially some sections have less than others leading to insights lacking exploration. | Most or some of the analysis has been covered (intrinsic and extrinsic factors could have been considered further). Evaluation includes a consideration of plans and what was reached (further detail required). Consideration of future plans based on this analysis is mentioned (could be more tangible or clearer). |
| **2.2 50-59% Adequate** | [Same as Good] | [Same as Good] |
| **3rd 40-49% Weak** | [Same as Good] | [Same as Good] |

You submit the Personal Portfolio asset for the first review and feedback by your Team Company of your Objectives by the end of October. The assessment for this module is the Portfolio of Self-Leadership. Once you have submitted the Personal Portfolio asset you do not need to submit it again. Throughout the year you update the portfolio and click save for your work to be saved.

**To submit, follow these instructions:**
Click in the top right-hand corner - "I want to…" > Share > With ATLAS for assessment, review, feedback or support > Portfolio Assignments (2023-26) > Personal Portfolio - Year 3 > Share asset.

#### Word Count
- Learning Contract: 3,500 words (indicative)
- SMART Objectives, Change Log and Feedback & Response: 1,000 words (Indicative)
- Activity Log Approval: 500 words (Indicative)

**Before submitting your work, please ensure that:**
- You have proofread your work thoroughly, so it is presented appropriately.
- You have addressed all the required elements of the assessment.
- You have addressed each of the marking criteria.
- The submission is in the correct format and correct location.
- All links work and have the relevant sharing permissions enabled.

### 4.1.7 What Do You Evidence?

- Records of discussions of feedback received and how you responded to it, i.e. what did you agree/disagree with, what did you change in your Objectives as a result. This should be recorded in the Feedback table in the SMART Objectives tab.
- Activity Log Approval utilising the spreadsheet linked within Appendix 1.

### 4.1.8 How to Use this Assignment Smartly!

**Use your SMART Objectives to guide your actions.**

Use your objectives to guide assignments and activities, e.g., choose topics for the 'LfO, TS Workshop Delivery' assignment that are relevant to your objectives or the competencies that you are developing. Create or get involved in events/projects/ventures (LbD) that enable you to work towards your objectives.

Use your objectives to guide decisions about the TE Programme opportunities you engage in – do they help you to achieve your objectives or build relevant competencies? E.g., Developing project management skills through the Global Business Challenge.

Use the feedback process to gain useful ideas from others, and to learn how to give feedback effectively. Feedback is sometimes hard to hear but gives us an opportunity to learn more about ourselves – our strengths and weaknesses – and how to make changes.

### 4.1.9 Assessment Offences

UWE Bristol's UWE's Assessment Offences Policy requires that you submit work that is entirely your own and reflects your own learning, so it is important to:

- Ensure you reference all sources used, using the UWE Harvard and the guidance available on UWE's Study Skills referencing pages.
- Avoid copying and pasting any work into this assessment, including your own previous assessments, work from other students or internet sources
- Develop your own style, arguments and wording, so avoid copying sources and changing individual words but keeping, essentially, the same sentences and/or structures from other sources
- Never give your work to others who may copy it
- If an individual assessment, develop your own work and preparation, and do not allow anyone to make amends on your work (including proof-readers, who may highlight issues but not edit the work) and when submitting your work, you will be required to confirm that the work is your own, and text-matching software and other methods are routinely used to check submissions against other submissions to the university and internet sources. Details of what constitutes plagiarism and how to avoid it can be found on UWE's Study Skills pages about avoiding plagiarism.

## 4.2 Assignment Brief 2: Reflection on Managing my Learning & Development

**Assignment Name:** Reflection on Managing my Learning & Development

**Submission Deadlines:**

Storyboard (presentation 10 mins, Q&A 5 mins):
- Week of 30 March 2026

NOTE: You'll need to ensure this week is free in your diary until the presentation date and time is provided.

You cannot use the +48h Late Submission Window. Extensions are not applicable unless Reasonable Adjustments (RA) are approved. Individuals with RAs should approach the Module Leader.

**Submission Locations:** Live assessment (on campus)

**Assessment Weighting:** 40% of the marks for the module

**Marks and feedback:** 20 working days after assessment deadline

### 4.2.1 Why this Assignment?

Part of the ability to lead yourself includes the ability to communicate a compelling argument. You are now in the third year of the programme and have experienced many forms of communication. Public speaking can be seen as one of the more challenging forms of communication. To tell a purposeful, convincing story is essential to gain buy-in, trust and belief in what you are communicating. Every enterprising individual should develop these skills to support their future careers.

### 4.2.2 What do You Need to Know to do this Assignment?

Identify what a storyboard looks like and how you can utilise that structure for your personal story. Design the storyboard based on your physical or digital skills, to present in an engaging way to captivate your audience.

Utilise knowledge and experience to inform your thinking, including competencies you have developed. Engage in research through the resource list, UWE library, Google Scholar, etc.

Demonstrate confidence in self-awareness and awareness of others. Determine how to formulate a clear argument to showcase your thought leadership on the topic of self-leadership.

### 4.2.3 Assignment Instructions

This is an individual assignment where you are required to create a storyboard presentation charting your personal development, self-leadership, and self-mastery journey on the Team Entrepreneurship programme. This should highlight **6 specific influential moments** that have shaped your learning. You are asked to display this storyboard on an A1 card or digital asset. You will present your storyboard to a small live assessment panel.

You will be expected to make links to relevant theories and concepts with references listed on the reverse of your storyboard or included in your digital asset. This assignment will allow you to reflect upon your journey in the Team Entrepreneurship programme, as well as support you to gain clarity on your exit strategy. Your creativity will be tested and awareness of your strengths and weaknesses will serve you well.

We recommend you share your storyboard with your Team Company as part of a Training Session in preparation for this assignment, to gain their feedback and perspectives on your journey. You can include a summary of the feedback received and your analysis of this on the reverse of the storyboard and within your presentation.

**IMPORTANT**

**Note 1:** The Marking Criteria is how the assessors mark your work. If you have not followed this, you will likely miss out on higher marks.

**Note 2:** Ensure the emphasis is on a topic of Self-Leadership, e.g. 'my learning style, self-managed learning frameworks, the science of habits, etc.' rather than 'what I learnt from experience'. Use experiences as an example or milestone to highlight your awareness about your self-leadership and explain how you learn or have managed your learning and development.

**Note 3:** Ensure there is enough of 'your own voice', i.e. your own opinion related to your specific context.

### 4.2.4 Overview of the Process

1. Start by reviewing your experience over the past years on TE to identify 6 influential experiences. Use your Learning Contracts and Reflection assignments to inform your thinking. Utilise feedback from team members, Team Coach, customers/clients and mentors.

2. Determine your exit strategy. In year 3 you would have been thinking about what you will do after TE. Demonstrate that you have a comprehensive plan, utilising your strengths in the career you want to pursue.

3. Build your storyboard using either a physical A1 card or create a digital asset. Practice your storyboard presentation to ensure you share what is important to you, and that it aligns with the marking criteria.

### 4.2.5 Format and Submission

You are required to give a **10-minute presentation** where you display your A1 card/digital storyboard and refer to the themes, concepts and learning represented in the storyboard. There will be **5 minutes for questions and answers**.

You must include your references, student name and number on the reverse of the storyboard or if using a digital asset, these should be embedded to be reviewed by the assessors.

You are not required to submit your storyboard before your assessment day. However, you should arrive early to set up your storyboard. If using a digital asset you should do a tech check before the presentation day to avoid tech issues.

The storyboard presentations will be marked live by an assessment panel. You will have at least two Team Coaches assessing your presentation, however, this is subject to change if two Team Coaches are not available.

You will be allocated a timeslot by the Module Leader closer to the assessment time. This will be released to your Team Company to review and make any swaps of timeslots. Once all team members have agreed on their timeslot a team leader must send the schedule back to the module leader for confirmation.

**Module Leader contact details:**
- Email: tom.depenthenyokelly@uwe.ac.uk
- MS Teams: @Tom de Pentheny O'Kelly

**Before presenting your work, please ensure that:**
- You have proofread your work thoroughly to ensure it is presented appropriately.
- You have addressed all the required elements of the assessment.
- You have referenced in accordance with the guidance provided.
- You have addressed each of the marking criteria.
- The submission is in the correct format.

### 4.2.9 Assessment Offences

UWE Bristol's UWE's Assessment Offences Policy requires that you submit work that is entirely your own and reflects your own learning, so it is important to:

- Ensure you reference all sources used, using the UWE Harvard and the guidance available on UWE's Study Skills referencing pages.
- Avoid copying and pasting any work into this assessment, including your own previous assessments, work from other students or internet sources
- Develop your own style, arguments and wording, so avoid copying sources and changing individual words but keeping, essentially, the same sentences and/or structures from other sources
- Never give your work to others who may copy it
- If an individual assessment, develop your own work and preparation, and do not allow anyone to make amends on your work (including proof-readers, who may highlight issues but not edit the work) and when submitting your work, you will be required to confirm that the work is your own, and text-matching software and other methods are routinely used to check submissions against other submissions to the university and internet sources. Details of what constitutes plagiarism and how to avoid it can be found on UWE's Study Skills pages about avoiding plagiarism.

## 6. Appendices

### 6.1 Appendix 1

#### Learning Contract:

Complete the first 4 questions at the beginning of the academic year and the 5th question at the end of the academic year. This is an opportunity to critically reflect and be open and honest about your past successes or challenges, your current personality, your future aspirations and your overall performance towards objectives.

1. Where have I been?
2. Where am I now?
3. Where do I want to get to?
4. How will I get there?
5. Where did I get to? (Final Analysis) Review the marking criteria for specifics on this question.

#### Objectives:

Create 6 SMART objectives to review and update throughout the year. This is a tool to support accountability and increase productivity through consistent planning and reviewing.

These objectives can be short (weeks/months) or medium-term (full year) objectives and therefore you should have a range of completed short-term objectives in your change log as you go through the year. Your medium-term objectives may not be completed till the end of the year; however, you can indicate progress in the "Level of Progress" column in the portfolio.

Objectives should focus on:
- **Self-development x2**, e.g. Personal habits, mindset and behaviours linked to entrepreneurship such as self-discipline, accountability, integrity, time management, etc.
- **Project/venture-development x2**, e.g. Skills related to running a project/venture, e.g. pitching skills, negotiation skills, financial management, project management, etc.
- **Team-development x2**, e.g. Specific roles and/or responsibilities related to the team, e.g. team targets, strategy, project, teamwork, communication, etc.

#### Feedback and Response:

As a Team Company, you provide peer-to-peer feedback on your 6 Objectives. You should gain feedback from a minimum of two team members per review, ensuring all your objectives have been reviewed each time.

This is to improve the quality and focus of objectives. As well as provide transparency of direction and ambition. The feedback should be responded to and actioned upon.

**What you give feedback on is prescribed below. How you give feedback to each other is a team decision. Use feedback criterion:**
- Are the objectives SMART?
- Is there alignment to the Learning Contract ambitions and competencies?
- Are these objectives appropriate to the team's direction?
- Are the objectives ambitious enough for the individual and year level?

Add feedback and responses in the portfolio table (Feedback and Response)

#### Activities Log and Approval:

As a Team Company, you are required to review each other's Practice and Enquiry activities once a month throughout the year (8 months) to assess whether activities have been completed according to requirements below. As a team, you can support each other to consistently engage in entrepreneurial activities towards your objectives as a self-directed learner (a key expectation of the programme), which is why the approval process is beneficial.

**Activity Log requirements:**
- Complete at least 2 LbD and 2 LfO activity this month, aligned to the expectations of each module?
- Are the activities aligned to any/all SMART objectives, or have appropriate justification for relevance to their entrepreneurial learning?
  - If they have done the above, then approve. If not, then the team member has 1 more chance to complete the work.

**Team Company to agree on the approval process. For example:** If the work has not been done by the agreed upon training session date, they have ... days to rectify and be approved.
- If not done by the agreed upon date, then do not approve.

Use the spreadsheet template (here) and link it in the Activity Log tab in the portfolio to complete each month.

#### Formative Feedback (from Team Coach):

Your Team Coach will have an initial one-to-one with you to discuss areas in the Learning Contract and SMART objectives to support clarity on your initial direction for the year. Later in the year the Team Coach will provide feedback on a sample of LfO, LbD & Competency Undertakings from the Team Company during a Training Session.

#### Competency Undertakings

Within the 4th question in the Learning Contract "How will I get there?" you'll record 6 competencies from the TE Competency Framework (here) you commit to developing throughout the year and indicate the level you are currently at. For those 6 competencies, you'll create a Competency Undertaking for each, to outline actions and specify learning you have gained to progress to the competency level achieved.

- Your initial level of progress should be documented at the beginning of the year in each undertaking.
- The Undertakings should be added to throughout the year, to highlight your progress.
- *These will be marked within the Practice and Enquiry Modules.

#### LfO & LbD Undertakings

In total 12 LfO & LbD Undertakings should be completed by the end of the academic year. 6 to be completed by the beginning of January and the other 6 by the end of April.

You should have many LfO & LbD activities you engaged in throughout the year listed in your Activities Log. Moreover, create Undertakings that highlight significant learning experiences that led to actions or future plans. *These will be marked within the Practice and Enquiry Modules.
