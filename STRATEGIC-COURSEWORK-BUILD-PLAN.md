# STRATEGIC COURSEWORK BUILD PLAN

**Goal:** Complete Year 3 coursework at 95-100% (Outstanding) level
**Timeline:** January - April 2026
**Approach:** Build in dependency order, maximizing quality and efficiency

---

## 🎯 THE GOLDEN RULE: Build in Dependency Order

**Core Principle:** Build components that OTHER things depend on FIRST.

**Why?** Because changing foundational components forces you to redo downstream work.

## 🎯 KEY PRINCIPLES

### 1. Build Foundation First
- Learning Contract Q1-Q4 before anything else
- Why? Everything else depends on this narrative

### 2. Competencies Drive Undertakings
- Choose 6 competencies in Q4
- Build undertakings that develop those competencies
- Why? Ensures alignment and focus

### 3. SMART Objectives Guide Activity
- Create objectives from competencies
- All undertakings support objectives
- Why? Prevents wasted effort on non-strategic work

### 4. LfO Before LbD
- Learn first (LfO), then apply (LbD)
- Why? You can't do what you don't know

### 5. Document in Real-Time
- Activity log monthly, not at end
- Why? Authenticity and accuracy
